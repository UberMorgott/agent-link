# Auto-Routing — Dynamic Model-Tier Selection and Team Composition

**Status**: Draft  
**Date**: 2026-06-12  
**Author**: Design session (Khaliq + Claude)

---

## 1. Problem

Today a user spawning a multi-agent team must manually decide:

- Which model to use as lead (haiku / sonnet / opus)
- How many workers to spawn
- What model tier each worker should be
- What specialisations each worker needs

This is expert knowledge. Most users shouldn't need to think about it. The goal is an `auto` mode where the user submits a task and the system determines the right team.

---

## 2. Empirical Foundation

The lifecycle eval suite (s01–s04) across haiku / sonnet / opus produces a clear capability gradient that should drive tier selection:

### Lead quality (s03 full lifecycle — spawn + coordinate + release)

| model  | bare    | one-liner | brief  | skill   | verdict                                                                                                              |
| ------ | ------- | --------- | ------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| haiku  | 60%     | 60%       | 20%    | 40%     | **weak lead** — inconsistent, better as worker                                                                       |
| sonnet | 40%     | **100%**  | 60%    | 80%     | **strong lead** — reliable with minimal onboarding                                                                   |
| opus   | **67%** | **67%**   | **0%** | **67%** | **capable lead** — all variants 67% after timeout fix EXCEPT brief (conditional clause causes 0%); fixed in codebase |

### Key findings — Claude models

- **Sonnet + one-liner = 100% lifecycle reliability** ✅ — confirmed production lead config
- **Haiku is worker-only** — caps at 60% lifecycle regardless of onboarding
- **Opus s02 bare = 100%** — knows the protocol natively; s03 original 40% cap was a timeout artifact (verbose responses exhausted 60s/phase window), not a capability gap
- **Opus s03 bare = 67% with 120s/phase** — timeout fix confirmed; responseMs() helper returns 120s for opus-class models; further improvement expected with more repeats
- **Skill text heuristic fix: partial improvement** — sonnet s01:skill improved 0%→33% after removing "do it yourself for quick lookups" heuristic. Not fully fixed: root cause is the task uses "worker agent" neutral vocabulary. s05 phrasing eval confirms: neutral-agent=20%, relay-worker=60%. Fix in production: use relay-anchored vocabulary ("relay worker") in Director meta-prompts (already done).
- **Phrasing matters for Claude**: s05 (running) measures whether relay-anchored vocabulary improves tool use independent of onboarding. Early haiku data (bare onboarding only): neutral-worker=0%, neutral-agent=20%, relay-worker=60%, relay-agent=20%, arw-worker=TBD, arw-agent=TBD. Confirmed: "relay worker" phrasing significantly outperforms neutral vocabulary even without onboarding text.

### Non-Claude harness lifecycle results (s01–s04 — all complete)

All onboarding variants × 5 runs each. Percentages = pass rate.

#### s01 — spawn only

#### s04 — no native subagents (spawn must use relay, not built-in Task tool)

| harness       | bare     | one-liner | brief    | skill    |
| ------------- | -------- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| codex         | **100%** | **100%**  | **100%** | **100%** |
| opencode:mimo | 80%      | **100%**  | **100%** | 80%      |

| cursor        | 0%       | 0%        | 0%       | 0%       |

**Key lifecycle findings:**

- **Codex**: 100% on all s01/s02/s04 variants; s03 bare=80%, one-liner/brief/skill=100%. Most reliable non-Claude harness — never routes to native subagents (s04=100% all variants).
- **Droid**: s03 bare/one-liner/brief all 100%, but s03 skill=0% (skill text confuses droid) and s04 bare/one-liner=0% (droid uses native Task tool, not relay, without explicit tool disambiguation). Droid is a strong lifecycle performer but will silently route to native subagents without the skill onboarding that disambiguates `add_agent` from `Task`.
- **Gemini**: s04 bare=80%, one-liner=60%, brief/skill=80%+. Mostly relay-native but with occasional fallback to native subagents.
- **OpenCode**: s03 bare=100% (best s03 bare!); one-liner=80%, brief=60%, skill=100%. Directive task prompts outperform — brief's conditional guidance hurts more than bare.
- **Droid**: s03 bare/one-liner/brief all 100% — exceptional result. Despite s02 bare=20%, the full s03 task description ("report DONE when complete with a concise summary") drives reliable release even with bare onboarding. Skill onboarding still running (1 fail seen).
- **Gemini**: s03 bare=60%, one-liner/brief/skill all 100%. The bare gap (release failure without onboarding) closes completely with any explicit context. Most consistent non-Claude lifecycle performance once prompted.
- **Grok/Cursor-agent**: 0% across all scenarios — not viable relay workers. Grok: model ignores MCP tools despite correct config. Cursor-agent: confirmed 0/48 (48 runs, s01–s04 × 4 onboarding variants) — model does not call `add_agent` or `remove_agent` regardless of onboarding level.

**Implication for Director prompt**: The auto-routing Director prompt already includes explicit `remove_agent` calls and directive task phrasing — this effectively acts as inline skill onboarding even for bare leads. All tested non-Claude harnesses (except grok/cursor) are viable relay workers with the right meta-prompt. Codex is the most consistently reliable across all onboarding tiers.

### Non-Claude phrasing results (s05 — bare onboarding only; 5 runs each, all complete)

| claude haiku  | 0%             | 20%           | 60%          | 20%         | 60%        | 40%       |
| claude sonnet | 0%             | 0%            | 0%           | 0%          | 40%        | 40%       |
| claude opus   | 60%            | 20%           | **100%**     | **100%**    | **100%**   | **100%**  |

**Key cross-harness insights**:

- Codex and OpenCode natively understand relay tools across all vocabulary variants (relay-native).
- Droid: "relay worker" (100%) and "neutral-agent"/"arw-agent" (100%) are tops; "arw-worker" (80%) slightly weaker.
- Gemini: "neutral-agent" and "arw-agent" both score 100%; "relay-agent" specifically hurts (40%). The "relay" prefix combined with "-agent" suffix confuses Gemini. "relay-worker" (80%) is safe. Director prompt uses "relay worker" — correct choice.
- Grok/Cursor: 0% all variants — not viable relay workers.
- Claude: vocabulary-dependent (see haiku/sonnet rows) — relay-anchored nouns matter.
- **Opus phrasing**: dramatically outperforms haiku/sonnet with relay-anchored vocabulary — relay-worker/relay-agent/arw-worker/arw-agent all 100%. Even neutral-worker 60% (vs 0% for haiku/sonnet). Opus has stronger native relay tool knowledge.
- **Universal recommendation**: Use "relay worker" noun in Director prompts — it's the highest-performing variant across both Claude models (haiku: 60%, opus: 100%) and non-Claude models (droid: 100%). "relay agent" underperforms on Gemini (40%) and Claude haiku (20%). "arw-agent" is surprisingly strong (opus/codex/opencode/droid: 100%).

## 3. Design

### 3.1 The `auto` entrypoint

```bash
agent-relay spawn Director --model=auto --task="refactor the auth module and add test coverage"
```

Or via the SDK:

```typescript
await relay.spawnAgent('Director', {
  model: 'auto',
  task: 'Refactor the auth module and add test coverage',
});
```

`auto` is resolved before the spawn call reaches the broker. It never reaches a model router; it is resolved by the **task classifier** in the CLI/SDK layer.

---

### 3.2 Task Classifier

A single lightweight LLM call (haiku-class, <200ms, ~$0.001) that returns a structured assessment:

```typescript
interface TaskAssessment {
  complexity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  parallelizable: boolean;
  subtasks: string[]; // inferred decomposition
  domains: string[]; // e.g. ["backend", "testing", "security"]
  estimatedWorkers: number; // 1–8
  reasoning: string; // short explanation for transparency
}
```

**Classifier prompt** (compressed):

```
You are a task router. Given a task description, assess:
1. complexity: low (single-step, clear output), medium (multi-step, some ambiguity),
   high (open-ended, requires judgment, cross-domain)
2. parallelizable: can this be split into independent tracks?
3. subtasks: list the natural sub-units (max 6)
4. domains: what specialisations are needed?
5. estimatedWorkers: how many parallel workers would help? (1 if serial)

Respond with JSON only.
```

---

### 3.3 Team Composer

Maps the assessment to a concrete team spec:

```typescript
interface TeamSpec {
  lead: { model: ModelTier; onboarding: OnboardingVariant };
  workers: Array<{
    role: string;
    model: ModelTier;
    task: string;
  }>;
}

type ModelTier = 'haiku' | 'sonnet' | 'opus';
```

**Routing table** (derived from eval data):

```
complexity=low,  parallel=false  →  lead: sonnet/one-liner,  workers: [haiku×1]
complexity=low,  parallel=true   →  lead: sonnet/one-liner,  workers: [haiku×N]
complexity=med,  parallel=false  →  lead: sonnet/one-liner,  workers: [sonnet×1]
complexity=med,  parallel=true   →  lead: sonnet/one-liner,  workers: [haiku×N, sonnet×1 (synthesiser)]
complexity=high, parallel=any    →  lead: opus/bare,         workers: [sonnet×N (+ haiku for grunt work)]
```

**Why bare/one-liner for leads (never brief/skill):**

- Conditional spawn guidance ("Spawn when... dedicated focus") gives capable models permission to skip delegation and reduces spawn rate to 0%. Validated: opus s03 brief=0% vs bare=67%, one-liner=67%.
- Directive language (just name the tool, no conditions) works best for sonnet/opus.
- Only haiku workers benefit from skill-level onboarding (they lack native protocol knowledge).
- Note: skill variant with disambiguation clause ("if task explicitly asks to delegate, always spawn") improves results but still underperforms bare/one-liner for capable models.

**Key invariants:**

- Lead is always sonnet or opus — haiku is never lead
- Opus lead only fires for `complexity=high` — it's the right tool but costs more
- Worker model matches subtask complexity, not overall task complexity
- `estimatedWorkers` from the classifier caps at 6 to prevent runaway spawns

---

### 3.4 Director Meta-Prompt

The lead is not asked to _decide_ the team — the routing has already done that. The meta-prompt tells the lead _what team it has_ and _what each worker's job is_:

```
You are Director, leading a {N}-worker team on this task:
{original task}

Your team:
{for each worker}
- {role} ({model tier}): {subtask description}

Spawn each worker using mcp__agent-relay__add_agent with their role as the name
and the subtask as their task. Wait for all workers to report DONE, then synthesise
their findings and release each worker with mcp__agent-relay__remove_agent.
```

This is critical: pre-composing the team means the lead's job is coordination, not planning. The lead doesn't have to decide whether to delegate — it's already been decided.

---

### 3.5 Onboarding injection per tier

The broker's model-aware injection (already implemented in `crates/broker/src/runtime/api.rs`) handles workers automatically:

- haiku workers → `SMALL_MODEL_RELAY_SKILL` prepended to task (broker-side injection)
- sonnet/opus workers → no injection needed

The lead gets the `one-liner` or `bare` onboarding baked into the meta-prompt — no separate injection needed since the meta-prompt already contains the tool names.

---

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 — Classifier (standalone, testable)

**File**: `packages/cli/src/auto/classifier.ts`

```typescript
export async function classifyTask(task: string): Promise<TaskAssessment>;
```

- Uses the configured default model (haiku-class) via the existing harness driver
- Pure function: string in, structured assessment out
- Adds ~200ms and ~$0.001 to spawn latency — acceptable

### Phase 2 — Team Composer

**File**: `packages/cli/src/auto/composer.ts`

```typescript
export function composeTeam(assessment: TaskAssessment): TeamSpec;
```

- Pure routing table lookup — no LLM call
- Capped at 6 workers
- Exposes the routing table as a config so it can be tuned from eval results

### Phase 3 — Director meta-prompt builder

**File**: `packages/cli/src/auto/director-prompt.ts`

```typescript
export function buildDirectorPrompt(task: string, team: TeamSpec): string;
```

- Templates the meta-prompt with the team spec
- Uses relay-anchored phrasing for worker nouns (findings from s05 eval will determine exact wording)

### Phase 4 — Wire into spawn

In `packages/cli/src/commands/spawn.ts` (or equivalent), intercept `model=auto`:

```typescript
if (spec.model === 'auto') {
  const assessment = await classifyTask(spec.task);
  const team = composeTeam(assessment);
  spec.model = team.lead.model;
  spec.task = buildDirectorPrompt(spec.task, team);
}
```

### Phase 5 — Eval coverage

New scenario **s06-auto-routing**: submit a `complexity=medium, parallel=true` task, measure whether the spawned team has the right lead tier and at least 2 workers spawned via relay tools.

---

## 5. Role-Fit Classification

The `choosing-swarm-patterns` skill (`skills/skills/choosing-swarm-patterns/`) defines 24 patterns with
named roles: `lead`, `worker`, `coordinator`, `planner`, `reviewer`, `critic`, `verifier`, `judge`,
`mapper`, `reducer`, `supervisor`, `debater`, `attacker`/`defender`, `saga-orchestrator`, etc.

The auto-routing composer must pick **both** the right pattern **and** the right harness per role slot.
This requires mapping each tested harness to the roles it can reliably fill.

### Role definitions (relevant subset)

| Role                | Requirements                                                     | Interactive?  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `lead`              | Orchestrates, DMs workers, aggregates, releases all              | yes           |
| `coordinator`       | Mid-level lead; manages sub-teams                                | yes           |
| `worker`            | Executes one bounded task, self-reports DONE, self-releases      | yes or no     |
| `planner`           | Produces structured plan (JSON/markdown), no coordination needed | no (one-shot) |
| `reviewer`/`critic` | Receives output, produces structured verdict with pass/fail      | no (one-shot) |
| `verifier`          | Checks evidence, gates on condition                              | no (one-shot) |
| `judge`             | Adjudicates between competing outputs                            | no (one-shot) |
| `mapper`            | Processes one item from a list (fan-out leaf)                    | no (one-shot) |
| `reducer`           | Aggregates mapper outputs into one result                        | no (one-shot) |
| `debater`           | Argues a position in multi-turn adversarial exchange             | yes           |

### Mapping eval signals → roles

What each eval scenario proves about role fitness:

| Signal                          | Role(s) it confirms                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| s01 pass                        | `worker` (spawn capable)                                                   |
| s02 pass                        | `worker` with self-release                                                 |
| s03 pass                        | `worker`, `planner` (non-interactive), `mapper`, `reducer`                 |
| s04 pass (relay-native)         | Safe for any role that involves spawning sub-agents                        |
| s03 + s04 pass + one-liner/bare | `reviewer`, `critic`, `verifier`, `judge` (high reliability, relay-native) |
| s03 + s04 all variants          | `coordinator` candidate (pending multi-DM test)                            |
| Lead eval (future s07)          | `lead` (multi-spawn + coordinate + aggregate confirmed)                    |

**Note on `lead` role**: s06 confirmed no single PTY agent can multi-spawn. The production solution
is CLI-layer pre-spawn (Phase 4). So the `lead` role in practice becomes _coordinator of a
pre-formed team_ — not responsible for spawning. Any model that passes s03+s04 at ≥80% is a
viable lead candidate for this coordinator-style role.

The `?` rows will be filled from the opencode Phase 1+2 batch eval. An s03+s04 pass
promotes a model from `?` to `~` for `worker`/`planner`/`mapper`; `~` becomes `✓` after
≥5 full-repeat runs.

### Pattern → required roles → harness selection

How the composer will pick harnesses for a given pattern:

| Pattern         | Roles needed               | Default harness assignment                                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| fan-out         | lead + N workers           | lead=claude:sonnet, workers=codex:gpt-5.5                        |
| pipeline        | N workers (sequential)     | codex:gpt-5.5 (interactive:false for non-final stages)           |
| hub-spoke       | lead + N workers           | lead=claude:sonnet, workers=codex:gpt-5.5                        |
| dag             | N workers (mixed deps)     | codex:gpt-5.5 (interactive:false where possible)                 |
| review-loop     | implementer + 2+ reviewers | implementer=codex:gpt-5.5, reviewers=claude:sonnet               |
| cascade         | haiku → sonnet → opus      | claude:haiku / claude:sonnet / claude:opus                       |
| map-reduce      | N mappers + 1 reducer      | mappers=codex:gpt-5.5 (interactive:false), reducer=claude:sonnet |
| reflection      | producer + critic          | producer=codex:gpt-5.5, critic=claude:sonnet                     |
| consensus       | N reviewers + judge        | reviewers=claude:sonnet, judge=claude:opus                       |
| debate          | 2 debaters + judge         | debaters=claude:sonnet, judge=claude:opus                        |
| competitive     | N independent implementers | codex:gpt-5.5 × N                                                |
| supervisor      | supervisor + N workers     | supervisor=claude:sonnet, workers=codex:gpt-5.5                  |
| circuit-breaker | primary + fallback         | primary=codex:gpt-5.5, fallback=claude:sonnet                    |
| red-team        | attacker + defender        | both=claude:sonnet (adversarial capable)                         |

Once opencode Chinese/alternative model evals complete, high-scoring models will be added as
viable alternatives — especially for `worker`, `planner`, `mapper`, and `reducer` roles where
relay-nativeness and reliability matter most.

### What still needs eval scenarios

The current s01–s06 suite tests `worker` and basic lifecycle. These additional scenarios are needed:

| Scenario     | Tests                                                    | Role confirmed                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| s07-reviewer | Receive code diff, output structured pass/fail verdict   | `reviewer`, `critic`, `verifier` |
| s08-planner  | Receive task, output JSON plan with subtasks and domains | `planner`                        |
| s09-judge    | Receive 2 competing outputs, pick winner with reasoning  | `judge`, `adjudicator`           |
| s10-mapper   | Receive one list item, transform it, return result       | `mapper` (interactive:false)     |
| s11-reducer  | Receive N outputs, aggregate into one                    | `reducer`                        |

Note: "relay-agent" specifically hurts gemini (40%)                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Does the Director meta-prompt reliably produce multi-worker spawns?   | ✅ done                     | **0% across all harnesses**. Root cause: PTY-mode agents make ONE add_agent call per turn then stop/wait for input — no prompt instruction chains two back-to-back add_agent calls. Production solution: pre-spawn workers in the CLI orchestrator layer (Phase 4), not in the Director. Director coordinates pre-spawned workers rather than spawning them. |

## 6. Open questions

1. **Multi-spawn Director behavior**: s06 eval (8 approaches, 0% PASS across codex/claude-sonnet) confirms this is a fundamental PTY-mode limitation — models make exactly ONE add_agent call per turn then stop/wait. No prompt instruction (CRITICAL labels, explicit ACTION sequences, orchestrator nudges) reliably chains two back-to-back spawns. **Resolved**: Production Phase 4 will pre-spawn workers from the CLI layer (before the Director starts) and give the Director pre-formed worker contexts to coordinate, not spawn. The Director prompt is redesigned accordingly: "Your team is online — coordinate them." rather than "Spawn your team."

2. **Classifier model cost trade-off**: haiku classifier call adds latency and cost. Is there a heuristic (task word count, presence of "and", number of domains) that can route without an LLM call for simple cases?

3. **Worker specialisation**: today workers get a task description. Should the team composer also inject domain-specific skill text (e.g. "you are a security auditor" for a security subtask)?

4. **Routing table update loop**: as eval data improves, the routing table should update. Should it be hardcoded, a JSON config, or learned from eval pass rates?

5. **Cost transparency**: user should see the estimated team cost before confirmation. `--dry-run` flag shows team spec without spawning.

6. **Team size cap**: 6 workers is a conservative default. Should this be per-workspace config?

---

## 7. Non-goals (for this phase)

- Dynamic re-routing mid-task (lead decides to add workers partway through)
- Nested teams (workers spawning sub-workers)
- Cross-node routing (all workers on same broker node for now)
- Cost optimisation beyond tier selection
