# OpenCode Relay Plugin

Agent Relay plugin for OpenCode — multi-instance messaging and orchestration via Relaycast.

## Install

```bash
opencode plugin add agent-relay
```

## Tools

| Tool            | Description                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `relay_connect` | Connect to an Agent Relay workspace  |
| `relay_send`    | Send a DM to another agent           |
| `relay_inbox`   | Check for new messages               |
| `relay_agents`  | List online agents                   |
| `relay_post`    | Post to a channel                    |
| `relay_spawn`   | Spawn a new OpenCode worker instance |
| `relay_dismiss` | Stop and release a spawned worker    |

## Quick Start

```
> Connect to relay workspace rk_live_... as "Lead"
> Spawn a worker called "Researcher" to investigate the auth module
> Check inbox for their findings
```

## Hooks

- **session.idle** — Polls inbox every 3s when idle, surfaces messages automatically
- **session.compacting** — Preserves relay state (agent name, workspace, workers) across compaction
- **session.end** — Graceful cleanup of spawned workers on session exit

> **Note:** Hook event names are provisional and may change with OpenCode plugin API updates.

## Environment Variables

| Variable           | Description                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RELAY_WORKSPACE`  | Workspace key passed to spawned workers (via env, never in prompts) |
| `RELAY_AGENT_NAME` | Agent name passed to spawned workers                                |

## Architecture

Unlike Claude Code and Gemini CLI plugins which use MCP servers, this plugin uses OpenCode's native `tool()` API with direct HTTP calls to the Relaycast API. No WebSocket client — polling via HTTP on `relay_inbox` calls and the `session.idle` hook.
