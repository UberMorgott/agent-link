# Codex Relay Skill

Codex-native multi-agent coordination via Relaycast.

## What it does

This package gives Codex a reusable relay coordination layer so sub-agents can communicate through Relaycast instead of staying limited to parent-only result collection.

It includes:

- a Codex skill that teaches lead and worker messaging protocol
- an Agent Relay MCP dependency declaration
- a template Agent Relay MCP config block for `.codex/config.toml`
- a `relay-worker` custom agent template for `.codex/agents/`

With these pieces installed, Codex can:

- coordinate teams through direct messages, channels, and threads
- require ACK/DONE signaling from workers
- let workers send peer-to-peer updates through Relaycast
- reuse the same relay workflow across project-scoped and user-scoped setups

## Installation

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/skills
cp -R plugins/codex-relay-skill .agents/skills/agent-relay
```

That's it. Everything else is automatic.

On first use, the skill self-installs by running `scripts/setup.sh`, which:

- adds the Agent Relay MCP server to `.codex/config.toml`
- enables `features.codex_hooks = true`
- writes `.codex/hooks.json` with SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, and Stop hooks
- installs `.codex/agents/relay-worker.toml`

All of this is idempotent — safe to run multiple times, and it merges with existing config rather than overwriting.

For user-wide availability, install to `$HOME/.agents/skills/agent-relay` instead.

### Optional: join an existing workspace

Set `RELAY_API_KEY` before launching Codex to join a specific Relaycast workspace:

```bash
export RELAY_API_KEY="rk_live_your_key_here"
```

If unset, a new workspace is auto-created on the first session.

<summary>Manual setup (advanced)</summary>

If you prefer to configure everything manually instead of using the auto-installer:

1. Add to `.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
features.codex_hooks = true

[mcp_servers.agent-relay]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "agent-relay", "mcp"]
env = { RELAY_API_KEY = "", RELAY_BASE_URL = "https://cast.agentrelay.com", RELAY_AGENT_TYPE = "agent" }
```

2. Copy hooks config:

```bash
cp .agents/skills/agent-relay/hooks/hooks.json .codex/hooks.json
```

3. Install the worker agent:

```bash
mkdir -p .codex/agents
cp .agents/skills/agent-relay/codex-config/relay-worker.toml .codex/agents/relay-worker.toml
```

</details>

## Usage

### Use the skill directly

Invoke the skill explicitly:

```text
$agent-relay Coordinate this refactor with two workers and keep all status updates in Relaycast.
```

Or describe the task naturally and let Codex match the skill from its description.

### Spawn relay workers

Once `relay-worker.toml` is installed, delegate bounded tasks to the `relay-worker` custom agent and include:

- the worker relay name
- the lead relay name
- the workspace-key source
- exact task scope
- completion criteria

Example:

```text
Spawn a relay-worker named api-worker.
Have it check Relaycast, ACK me, update the API route tests only, send STATUS after the first green test run, and send DONE with evidence before exit.
```

### Coordinate a team

Use Relaycast when workers need to message each other directly, not only the lead. Good fits:

- parallel implementation across separate subsystems
- lead/worker review loops
- shared channel updates for longer-running tasks
- cross-terminal or cross-machine collaboration

Installed layout in a project typically looks like:

```text
.agents/skills/agent-relay/   # Skill directory Codex scans
.codex/config.toml            # Runtime Agent Relay MCP server + features.codex_hooks
.codex/hooks.json             # Hook wiring (copied from skill)
.codex/agents/relay-worker.toml
```
