/**
 * Bake the PostHog write key into the compiled CLI before it is published.
 *
 * Why this exists: the npm package is plain `tsc` output, so there is no
 * bundler step that could inline an env var, and the release workflow publishes
 * with `--ignore-scripts`, which rules out a `prepublishOnly` hook. Without this
 * step the published CLI resolves no key and every event it emits is silently
 * dropped — which is exactly what shipped until now.
 *
 * The key is a PostHog *project ingest* key: write-only and public by design,
 * the same category as a Sentry DSN. The Rust broker already embeds one via
 * `option_env!`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   AGENT_RELAY_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_xxx node scripts/inject-posthog-key.mjs
 *   node scripts/inject-posthog-key.mjs --check     # verify a key is present
 *
 * With no key in the environment this is a no-op and exits 0, so local and fork
 * builds keep shipping with telemetry disabled.
