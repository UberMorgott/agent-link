/**
 * verify-features.ts
 *
 * Automated feature health check for agent-relay. Walks every user-facing
 * feature tier by tier, records one structured result per check, and turns a
 * failure into action: a Slack alert, a GitHub issue, an attempted fix on a
 * branch, and a draft PR carrying re-verified evidence.
 *
 * Designed to run on a schedule (nightly or post-merge):
 *   relay cloud schedule workflows/verify-features.ts --cron "0 3 * * *"
 *
 * Or manually:
 *   relay node workflow run workflows/verify-features.ts
 *
 * Pattern: pipeline (sequential phases — later tiers assume earlier ones ran)
 *
 * ## Why this file is shaped the way it is
 *
 * An earlier version of this workflow reported "COMPLETED — 11 passed, 0
 * failed" on a run where Tier 2 had four failing checks. Three independent
 * defects produced that false green, and each one is now closed here:
 *
 *   1. Every step set `failOnError: false`, so a non-zero exit still scored as
 *      a pass. Tiers still use it (we want all tiers to run even after one
 *      fails), but they are no longer the verdict — `verdict` is, and it reads
 *      a machine-readable ledger rather than grepping prose logs.
 *   2. Nothing aggregated the per-tier results into a run verdict. `verdict`
 *      plus `enforce-verdict` now do, and `main()` sets a non-zero process exit
 *      so a scheduler sees red.
 *   3. `main()` discarded the runner result entirely. It now reads verdict.json
 *      and fails closed when that file is missing.
 *
 * A fourth defect was subtler. `applyReliabilityDefaults` in @relayflows/core
 * force-enables `strategy: "retry"` with a repair agent for any workflow that
 * declares agents, so a failing verification gate got handed to an agent that
 * edited the working tree until the gate passed. A verification workflow whose
 * assertions can be rewritten to make them pass measures nothing. `onError`
 * is set to "continue" below specifically to opt out of that path.
 *
 * ## Honest accounting
 *
 * Every check records `pass`, `fail`, or `skip` with a reason. A check that
 * cannot run in this environment (no cloud login, no provider CLI) is a SKIP
 * with a stated cause — never a pass, and never a fail. `verdict` also fails
 * the run when a tier produced no records at all, so a tier that crashes
 * before its first check cannot masquerade as a clean tier.
 *
 * Feature manifest: .agentworkforce/features/manifest.yaml
 * Critical paths:   .agentworkforce/features/critical-paths.md
 * Procedures ref:   .agentworkforce/features/verify/procedures.md
 * Manifest audit:   workflows/audit-feature-manifest.ts
 *
 * ## Environment
 *
 *   VERIFY_SLACK_CHANNEL    Slack channel ID for failures. Default C0AEKNLDNKW.
 *   VERIFY_AUTOFIX          "0" disables the issue/fix/PR path. Default on.
 *   VERIFY_ALLOW_CLI_DRIFT  "1" downgrades a CLI-vs-repo version mismatch from
 *                           a failure to a warning.
 *   POSTHOG_API_KEY         Delivers PostHog evidence. On FAIL, a missing key
 *                           is recorded as a failed escalation. Host: POSTHOG_HOST.
 *   NIGHTCTO_EVIDENCE_URL   Enables infra escalation to NightCTO.
 *   NIGHTCTO_EVIDENCE_TOKEN Bearer token for the above.
 *   CLOUD_API_URL           Required for Slack delivery. Slack posts go through
 *   CLOUD_API_TOKEN         the relayflows Slack primitive's cloud-relay runtime
 *                           (/api/v1/slack/post-message), which uses the
 *                           workspace's configured Slack integration. No bot
 *                           token is read.

  - Any tier with no records  => run FAIL (a crashed tier is not a clean tier).

A FAIL posts to Slack, opens a GitHub issue, and attempts a fix on a branch
with a draft PR. A failure of the harness itself escalates to NightCTO. Each
Slack attempt also emits a credential-free relay-alert-envelope/1 artifact for
a trusted scheduler postback; an envelope is a handoff, not a delivery receipt.

  // ── Phase 10b: RelayFlow proof-case regression corpus ────────────────────
  //
  // Every merged feature/bug-fix PR leaves behind a case under
  // tests/relayflows/cases/ that discriminates the bug: a `base` arm that
  // reproduces it and a `head` arm that does not. Those cases are the sharpest
  // regression assets this repo has — each one is a real end-to-end
  // reproduction someone already paid to build and get right.
  //
  // They were also, until this tier, run exactly once each. The PR-proof
  // dispatcher selects only the single case a PR declares, and
  // `scripts/pr-proof/prepare.mjs` hard-fails a PR that changes any other case
  // ("A PR must change exactly its one declared RelayFlow case"), so a later PR
  // cannot re-run an earlier proof even in principle. Reintroduce a fixed bug
  // and nothing notices.
  //
  // This tier re-runs the corpus head-only against the current checkout and
  // requires each case to still report its `head` signature. A case that now
  // reports its `base` signature is a regression of that exact bug, named.
  //
  // Head-only is deliberate. Outside a PR there is no meaningful base SHA, and
  // asserting the fixed behaviour is the property we actually want to hold on
  // main. A case whose runner cannot execute at all is recorded as a skip with
  // its cause, never as a pass — an unrunnable proof must not read as a
  // verified one.

## FIRST: check whether there is anything to do

Read ${ARTIFACTS}/autofix.env and ${VERDICT_FILE}.

- If ${ARTIFACTS}/autofix.env contains \`AUTOFIX=0\`, the operator has disabled
  the fix path. Write "Autofix disabled." to ${ARTIFACTS}/fix-summary.md and
  STOP IMMEDIATELY.
- If ${VERDICT_FILE} does not exist, or its "verdict" field is "PASS", there is
  NOTHING to fix. Write "No failures — nothing to fix." to
  ${ARTIFACTS}/fix-summary.md and STOP IMMEDIATELY.
- In either case: do not read other files, do not create a branch, do not edit
  anything, do not run any commands.
- Only if autofix is enabled AND "verdict" is "FAIL" do you continue.

(The workflow engine has no conditional steps, so this step is scheduled on
every run. The early exit above is what keeps a green run from spending model
time and, more importantly, from letting an agent loose on a clean tree.)

## The task

Read ${VERDICT_FILE} for the authoritative list of failing checks, and the
per-tier logs in ${ARTIFACTS}/ for detail.

## Hard rules

1. NEVER commit or push to \`main\`. Work on a branch named exactly
   \`${FIX_BRANCH}\`. Create it from the current HEAD.
2. Fix the ROOT CAUSE in product code. Do NOT make a check pass by weakening,
   deleting, or loosening the check itself. If a check is genuinely wrong (it
   tests a command that was intentionally removed, or asserts something the
   product never promised), you may correct the check — but you must say so
   explicitly and justify it in your summary.
3. Do NOT reduce the number of checks in \`workflows/verify-features.ts\`. A
   later gate counts them and will reject the branch if the count drops.
4. Re-run the specific failing tier after your fix and paste the real output as
   evidence. A fix with no re-run is not a fix.
5. Classify EVERY failed check separately. "Environmental" is allowed only
   with concrete evidence from a named command/log proving the missing external
   prerequisite. A blanket statement that all failures are environmental is
   invalid. If evidence is insufficient, use category \`unknown\`, not
   \`environmental\`.
6. A \`cli-belongs-to-checkout\` failure is category \`provenance\`, never
   environmental: it means the run exercised a different artifact and the
   remaining results are not evidence about this checkout.
7. A failure whose evidence contains \`Recovery authority does not match the
   expected agent identity\` is category \`identity\`, never environmental or
   "missing broker". Preserve that exact evidence for human review.
8. If a failure is genuinely environmental (no cloud login, no provider CLI,
   expired credentials), do NOT patch code. Explain the evidence and change
   nothing for that specific failure.

## Deliverables

Write a file \`${ARTIFACTS}/fix-summary.md\` containing:

- \`Root cause:\` one paragraph per distinct failure, naming the file and symbol.
- \`Change:\` what you edited and why it addresses the root cause.
- \`Evidence:\` the exact command you re-ran and its output.
- \`Environmental:\` any failures you deliberately did not patch, and why.
- \`Assertions changed:\` any verification check you modified, with justification,
  or "none".

Also write \`${ARTIFACTS}/failure-assessment.json\` as a JSON array with exactly
one object per entry in verdict.json's failure arrays. Every object must have:

- \`tier\` and \`check\`: exact strings from verdict.json.
- \`category\`: one of \`product\`, \`provenance\`, \`identity\`,
  \`environmental\`, or \`unknown\`.
- \`evidence\`: the concrete log line or command output supporting the category.
- \`reasoning\`: why that evidence supports the category and whether code changed.

The integrity gate rejects missing entries, evidence-free environmental claims,
and provenance/identity failures mislabeled as environmental. This assessment is
included in the Slack follow-up so a human can disagree with your judgement.

Commit your work on the branch. Do NOT open a pull request — a later step does
that. Do NOT merge anything.`,
