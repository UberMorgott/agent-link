## Summary

Made the zero-age retention fixture deterministic across filesystem clocks by injecting a future comparison time; production retention behavior is unchanged.

**Approach:** Standard approach

---

## Key Decisions

### Inject a future test clock for zero-age abandonment
- **Chose:** Inject a future test clock for zero-age abandonment
- **Reasoning:** The production grace period is seven days, but the zero-age fixture compared a newly created filesystem mtime with a clock captured slightly earlier. Passing now explicitly makes the boundary deterministic without weakening retention.
