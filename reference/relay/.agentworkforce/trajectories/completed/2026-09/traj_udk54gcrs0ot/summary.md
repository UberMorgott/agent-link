## Summary

Repaired PR #1691 so unreadable non-functional declarations require proof without a fabricated bugfix kind, preserved explicit feature/bugfix kinds, added regression coverage, and corrected the Trail scope metadata.

**Approach:** Standard approach

---

## Key Decisions

### Treat the cubic P3 as valid and preserve declared bugfix kinds while clearing the synthetic fallback only for unreadable non-functional declarations
- **Chose:** Treat the cubic P3 as valid and preserve declared bugfix kinds while clearing the synthetic fallback only for unreadable non-functional declarations
- **Reasoning:** The contract knows a declared bugfix kind even when the diff is unavailable; the defect is coercing non-functional plus unknown diff to bugfix. This is the narrowest semantic repair and avoids widening unrelated behavior.

## Chapters

### 1. Work
*Agent: default*

- Treat the cubic P3 as valid and preserve declared bugfix kinds while clearing the synthetic fallback only for unreadable non-functional declarations: Treat the cubic P3 as valid and preserve declared bugfix kinds while clearing the synthetic fallback only for unreadable non-functional declarations
- Audit confirmed the single hosted P3 is valid: unreadable non-functional declarations were required but mislabeled as bugfix by the fallback. Rebased cleanly onto origin/main, narrowed kind to null only for that unverifiable path, preserved explicit bugfix metadata, and focused contract coverage passes.
