## Summary

Implemented Plan 001: Node 22 baseline, experimental AI SDK harness adapters, canonical lifecycle and semantic observability, Relaycast publication, PTY fallback parity, CLI attach rendering, replay, capability reporting, and benchmark/soak coverage; completed three adversarial review rounds and full JS/Rust verification.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Adopt exact published AI SDK harness family and Node 22.14 CI baseline

- **Chose:** Adopt exact published AI SDK harness family and Node 22.14 CI baseline
- **Reasoning:** All six official packages resolve to one HarnessV1 1.0.34 family and require Node >=22; 22.14.0 is already the repository's pinned Node 22 CI release.

### Model canonical activity as a pure reducer over the existing AgentSessionEvent envelope

- **Chose:** Model canonical activity as a pure reducer over the existing AgentSessionEvent envelope
- **Reasoning:** Keeping activity separate from durable status and carrying source/fidelity/sequence on canonical session observations lets AI SDK and PTY runtimes share listeners while observer replay remains deduplicated and monotonic.

### Host public HarnessV1 directly and make the semantic sidecar a thin protocol adapter

- **Chose:** Host public HarnessV1 directly and make the semantic sidecar a thin protocol adapter
- **Reasoning:** Retaining HarnessV1PromptControl preserves active input and approvals; the sidecar only translates broker commands/events while RelaySession owns ordering and deduplication.

### Hash runtime-owned session state paths and sanitize work-directory segments

- **Chose:** Hash runtime-owned session state paths and sanitize work-directory segments
- **Reasoning:** Session identifiers cross a protocol boundary and must never become deletion paths or escape the configured workspace.

### Use broker-owned semantic sidecars with versioned framed commands, per-agent monotonic event sequences, and bounded per-agent replay

- **Chose:** Use broker-owned semantic sidecars with versioned framed commands, per-agent monotonic event sequences, and bounded per-agent replay
- **Reasoning:** This keeps PTY behavior unchanged while giving supported harnesses structured lifecycle, input acknowledgements, reconnect reconciliation, and a stable benchmark for adapter parity.

### Use deterministic fake adapters for CI contracts and gate real CLI turns behind RELAY_INTEGRATION_REAL_CLI=1

- **Chose:** Use deterministic fake adapters for CI contracts and gate real CLI turns behind RELAY_INTEGRATION_REAL_CLI=1
- **Reasoning:** Keeps ordinary CI stable and credential-free while preserving an explicit real-adapter verification path with named per-adapter skips.

### Report PTY parity per activity and semantic family

- **Chose:** Report PTY parity per activity and semantic family
- **Reasoning:** AI SDK is the reference profile; exact, inferred, and unavailable signals remain visible without a misleading scalar score.

### Publish canonical lifecycle through Relaycast agent event storage and wire PTY broker evidence into the shared translator

- **Chose:** Publish canonical lifecycle through Relaycast agent event storage and wire PTY broker evidence into the shared translator
- **Reasoning:** Remote applications need durable cross-process observability; AI SDK remains the reference profile while PTY emits only exact/inferred signals it can prove

### Parallelized lazy adapter imports in the registry test and gave the package-load assertion a 15-second ceiling

- **Chose:** Parallelized lazy adapter imports in the registry test and gave the package-load assertion a 15-second ceiling
- **Reasoning:** The assertion validates adapter availability, not sequential import latency; the full-suite 5-second timeout was flaky while all adapters loaded successfully in under one second when independent imports ran concurrently.
