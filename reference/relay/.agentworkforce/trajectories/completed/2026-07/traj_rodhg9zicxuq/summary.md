## Summary

Reverted the AgentRelaySDK retirement, then rebuilt it as a rich translating facade over relaycast v6.0.5: threads, inbox, deliveries, channels, agents, nodes, triggers, integrations, files, workspace admin, attachments, and a typed listener hub. Added translation + listener unit tests, README, and a Minor CHANGELOG entry. Swift toolchain unavailable so verified by close reading against the cloned v6.0.5 API.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Target Relaycast v6.0.5 and build a translating facade layer

- **Chose:** Target Relaycast v6.0.5 and build a translating facade layer
- **Reasoning:** v6.0.5 natively exposes threads/inbox/deliveries/channels/agents/nodes/triggers/webhooks/workspace; restored 5.x-era code is API-compatible with 6.0.5. Facade translates Relaycast.\* into relay-owned types, mirroring the TS SDK's relaycast-translate/relaycast-client boundary.
