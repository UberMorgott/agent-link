## Summary

Merged origin/main into the PR branch: migrated agent-relay-mcp.ts, mcp/types.ts, mcp/workspace.ts, mcp/resources.ts to @agent-relay/sdk thin clients, kept relaycast-telemetry.ts deleted, merged CHANGELOG (main's reconciled Unreleased + PR's two entries), regenerated lockfile without @relaycast/sdk in cli. Verified: build:core clean, sdk 120 tests, root 1128 tests, knip identical to main modulo line shift.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Kept PR relevant and re-applied migration onto main's modularized MCP

- **Chose:** Kept PR relevant and re-applied migration onto main's modularized MCP
- **Reasoning:** main still imported raw @relaycast/sdk in agent-relay-mcp.ts and new mcp/ modules (types, workspace, resources); no thin-client surface existed on main, so the PR's premise held

### Resolved conflicts by taking main's file layout and porting the thin-client migration into it

- **Chose:** Resolved conflicts by taking main's file layout and porting the thin-client migration into it
- **Reasoning:** main split the MCP monolith into mcp/ modules (1600-line restructure); mechanically merging stale hunks was riskier than re-applying the 6 raw call-site migrations onto main's version

### Replaced RelaySpawnAgentInput.model with metadata

- **Chose:** Replaced RelaySpawnAgentInput.model with metadata
- **Reasoning:** main now forwards model via spawn metadata since upstream SpawnAgentRequest has no top-level model field
