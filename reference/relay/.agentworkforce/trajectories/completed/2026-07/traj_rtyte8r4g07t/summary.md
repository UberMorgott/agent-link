## Summary

Combined session spanning four workstreams: broker_panic telemetry hook sending synchronously from a dedicated OS thread (#881); feature manifest audit reconciling the catalog with Commander/MCP/SDK surfaces plus contract tests; cloud worker teardown PID verification; and Reflex diagnostics made quiet by default, verbose on demand, and structured-log-file aware (relayhistory issue #41 opened for native importer quiet control).

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### broker_panic sends synchronously via a fresh OS-thread current-thread runtime

- **Chose:** broker_panic sends synchronously via a fresh OS-thread current-thread runtime
- **Reasoning:** Panic may occur on a tokio worker thread and the process may abort before the async sender loop drains; a dedicated std::thread with its own runtime avoids nested-runtime panic, and the reqwest timeout bounds process teardown

### Audit exact Commander registrations and SDK/MCP exports rather than relying on existing manifest prose

- **Chose:** Audit exact Commander registrations and SDK/MCP exports rather than relying on existing manifest prose
- **Reasoning:** The manifest already contains stale aliases and incomplete argument syntax, so repository source is the authoritative contract.

### Cloud worker teardown verifies the stored PID still belongs to the worker's foreground child

- **Chose:** Cloud worker teardown verifies the stored PID still belongs to the worker's foreground child
- **Reasoning:** The daemon is detached and persisted locally; checking worker ID plus --foreground-child before TERM/KILL prevents a stale or reused PID from targeting an unrelated process.

### Keep Reflex diagnostics quiet by default; route Relay-originated events to the shared file logger and reveal them on --verbose

- **Chose:** Keep Reflex diagnostics quiet by default; route Relay-originated events to the shared file logger and reveal them on --verbose
- **Reasoning:** The broker console is user-facing startup output, while Reflex is background maintenance. Native importer output needs an upstream quiet control because it bypasses Relay's logger.

- Audit exact Commander registrations and SDK/MCP exports rather than relying on existing manifest prose: Audit exact Commander registrations and SDK/MCP exports rather than relying on existing manifest prose
- Parallel audits reconciled the manifest with Commander registrations, MCP tools, SDKs, harnesses, and plugins. The catalog now uses explicit category-to-procedure mappings with contract tests so CLI and MCP drift fails locally before review.
