## Summary

Added per-worker byte offsets to worker_stream + snapshot response (relay-pty consumed_offset atomic, pty_worker flush-before-snapshot); reworked drive/view/passthrough to subscribe-first buffering + offset reconcile via shared StreamSyncBuffer; moved drive resize after WS subscribe; fixed pending inflation via sinceSeq cutoff (new currentSeq in /api/events/replay). Rust + TS tests green.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Filed issue #1247 with consolidated audit; fixing in 5 sequential workstreams on one branch

- **Chose:** Filed issue #1247 with consolidated audit; fixing in 5 sequential workstreams on one branch
- **Reasoning:** Workstreams share files (attach-drive.ts, pty_worker.rs); sequential agents avoid conflicts. Opus for the 4 hard workstreams (stream cursor sync, async loop, session robustness, snapshot modes), Sonnet for mechanical transport/misc fixes

### Report snapshot offset as grid consumed-offset (atomic under term lock); flush coalescing buffer before snapshot; clients subscribe-first + reconcile by offset

- **Chose:** Report snapshot offset as grid consumed-offset (atomic under term lock); flush coalescing buffer before snapshot; clients subscribe-first + reconcile by offset
- **Reasoning:** Grid is causally ahead of the stream; offset must reflect what the grid painted, and flushing aligns the emission boundary to minimize straddle duplication
