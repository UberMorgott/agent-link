## Summary

Corrected the AI SDK roadmap by distinguishing five external HarnessV1 adapters from dozens of model providers and added a self-contained relay-native provider plan.

**Approach:** Standard approach

---

## Key Decisions

### Separate external harness adapters from model-provider support

- **Chose:** Separate external harness adapters from model-provider support
- **Reasoning:** AI SDK provider packages such as @ai-sdk/xai standardize model inference but do not launch coding CLIs. Relay should retain Plan 001 for HarnessV1/PTy runtimes and add a dependent relay-native ToolLoopAgent harness that can use the broader provider registry with Relay-owned tools and semantic attach.
