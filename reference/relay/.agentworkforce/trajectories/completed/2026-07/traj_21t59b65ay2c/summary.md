## Summary

Merged origin/main into PR #1099 branch, adapted SDK type derivation to @relaycast/types 6.0.2, fixed toSnakeKey leading-underscore bug from review, replied to both Gemini comments. All checks green: sdk 120 tests, root 1211 tests, typecheck, build, prettier.

> **Recording note:** This trajectory was recorded retroactively. The work described above was already committed in merge commit `10e023e` before `trail start` ran, so the trace window opened and closed at that same HEAD. That is why `_trace.startRef == endRef == 10e023e` and `commits`/`filesChanged` are empty — no commit occurred inside the trace window. See commit `10e023e` for the actual diff.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Adapted canonical type derivation to @relaycast/types 6.x instead of pinning 3.x

- **Chose:** Adapted canonical type derivation to @relaycast/types 6.x instead of pinning 3.x
- **Reasoning:** Main upgraded @relaycast/sdk to ^6.0.0 whose ledger renamed the delivery lifecycle (accepted->queued, deferred dropped, acked/dead_lettered added) and moved spawn/release off the WS event contract; kept public relay unions unchanged by mapping acked->read and dead_lettered->failed, keeping legacy 3.x statuses parseable, and deriving InjectionResult.status from MessageReceipt

### Kept agent_name-first participant mapping, fixed doc comment instead of swapping to agent_id

- **Chose:** Kept agent_name-first participant mapping, fixed doc comment instead of swapping to agent_id
- **Reasoning:** Pre-refactor behavior preferred names and relay addresses agents by name; canonical rows only carry agent_id so orders are equivalent on canonical engines
