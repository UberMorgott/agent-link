## Summary

Addressed PR 1268 review feedback by synchronizing requested channel stream registration before subscribe, documenting the ordering contract, bounding lifecycle tests with throwing deadlines, removing obsolete broker subscription state, applying Swift registry cleanups, and correcting duplicated trajectory prose. All 151 Swift tests pass.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Coordinate requested channel stream registration with subscribe

- **Chose:** Coordinate requested channel stream registration with subscribe
- **Reasoning:** Preserves lossless subscription startup for consumers that request events first while keeping join-only subscriptions free of unused event buffers; documented the required ordering in API docs and quick start.

## Chapters

### 1. Work

_Agent: default_

- Coordinate requested channel stream registration with subscribe: Coordinate requested channel stream registration with subscribe
- Addressed every valid new review thread: registration ordering, bounded test waits, obsolete broker state, Swift dictionary cleanups, and duplicated trajectory prose. Two Dictionary.Values suggestions remain intentionally unapplied because finishAll mutates registry values; the trajectory empty-commit warning misreads one conflict-resolution record as the whole PR.
