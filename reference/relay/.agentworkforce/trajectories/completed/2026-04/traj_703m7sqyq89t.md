## Summary

Fixed docs/blog content loading so runtime resolves MDX from the deployed filesystem instead of a build-machine absolute path, and added content/docs plus content/blog to Next output file tracing. Verification was partial because next build still hits unrelated intermittent prerender errors after compile and type-check.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Stopped docs and blog content loaders from binding to build-machine absolute paths, and explicitly traced MDX content into the Next server bundle

- **Chose:** Stopped docs and blog content loaders from binding to build-machine absolute paths, and explicitly traced MDX content into the Next server bundle
- **Reasoning:** The production stack showed a read against /home/runner/work/.../web/content/docs/introduction.mdx, which means the docs loader baked the GitHub runner path into the server chunk via import.meta.url. Resolving content from runtime cwd candidates fixes the path, and tracing content/docs plus content/blog ensures those source files are present in the deployed artifact.
