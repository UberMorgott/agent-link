## Summary

Reviewed PR 1032 docs default-version changes. Removed stale Next bare-doc redirects that intercepted new v8 docs routes, taught docs version helpers to parse old /docs/8.0.0 URLs, and added focused unit tests for v8, legacy archive, and transitional paths. Web unit tests and web TypeScript pass; Next production build was attempted twice and killed by the host with exit 137 during optimized build.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Removed stale bare docs redirect table

- **Chose:** Removed stale bare docs redirect table
- **Reasoning:** Next redirects run before app routes and were redirecting new v8 bare docs pages such as /docs/cli-messaging to replacement pages, defeating the PR's v8 default routes and updated links.
