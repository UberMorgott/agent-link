## Summary

Wired registerAction onto relaycast 2.3.0 fire-and-forget actions: SDK registers descriptor, subscribes handler agent to action.invoked, runs local registry, posts completion. MCP invoke is now fire-and-forget with local fallback.

**Approach:** Standard approach

### 1. Work

_Agent: default_

- Phase 1a: workspace.register/reconnect return a live RelayAgentClient (identity+status+reply/react); added messageId, agents.me(), injectable agent-messaging factory; migrated openclaw to relaycast 2.3.0 unified messageReacted event: Phase 1a: workspace.register/reconnect return a live RelayAgentClient (identity+status+reply/react); added messageId, agents.me(), injectable agent-messaging factory; migrated openclaw to relaycast 2.3.0 unified messageReacted event

- Phase 2a: added relay.addListener(name|wildcard|predicate, handler) over a discriminated RelayEvent union with rich envelope; maps camelCase raw events to dotted public names across messaging/action/session sources: Phase 2a: added relay.addListener(name|wildcard|predicate, handler) over a discriminated RelayEvent union with rich envelope; maps camelCase raw events to dotted public names across messaging/action/session sources
- Phase 2b (partial): removed relay.on/relay.notify (zero prod callers); migrated listener tests to addListener. Deferred relay.actions getter removal pending MCP/harness-driver tracing.: Phase 2b (partial): removed relay.on/relay.notify (zero prod callers); migrated listener tests to addListener.

- Removed two deferred surfaces via subagents: public relay.actions namespace and top-level relay.sendMessage (interface split — agent clients keep sendMessage, workspace does not): Removed two deferred surfaces via subagents: public relay.actions namespace and top-level relay.sendMessage (interface split — agent clients keep sendMessage, workspace does not)
- Phase 3b: AgentSession.release optional + lifecycle.release:boolean. Strict compile-time 'iff' rejected — discriminated union fights the README's const-capabilities pattern (literals widen to boolean); documented the pairing convention instead.: Phase 3b: AgentSession.release optional + lifecycle.release:boolean.
