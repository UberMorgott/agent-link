## Summary

npm audit clean (0 vulns): vitest 3->4 + postcss override; 820 tests green, cross-platform lockfile preserved

**Approach:** Standard approach

---

## Key Decisions

### Bumped vitest to ^4.1.0 (critical CVE) and added postcss ^8.5.10 override (moderate CVE); migrated mocked-class test patterns to constructable functions for Vitest 4 new.target semantics

- **Chose:** Bumped vitest to ^4.1.0 (critical CVE) and added postcss ^8.5.10 override (moderate CVE); migrated mocked-class test patterns to constructable functions for Vitest 4 new.target semantics
- **Reasoning:** vitest 4.1.0 is the only patched release for GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp; postcss override patches next-bundled 8.4.31; surgically edited lockfile to apply override without pruning cross-platform optional deps
