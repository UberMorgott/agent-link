## Summary

Updated agent-relay and @agent-relay/sdk to require @relaycast/sdk ^4.1.2 after the matching @relaycast/types 4.1.2 package became available, preserving caret ranges instead of pinning.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Bumped Relaycast SDK range instead of pinning

- **Chose:** Bumped Relaycast SDK range instead of pinning
- **Reasoning:** @relaycast/types@4.1.2 is now published, so the repo can keep caret semantics while requiring the fixed Relaycast SDK release.
