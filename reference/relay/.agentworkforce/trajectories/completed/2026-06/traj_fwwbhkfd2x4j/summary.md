## Summary

Preserved cloud operator refresh-token expiry metadata in @agent-relay/cloud, refreshed canonical sessions before access/refresh renewal windows, exposed refresh expiry through agent-relay cloud session, and verified targeted tests plus package typechecks.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Preserve refresh token expiry and proactively refresh cloud sessions

- **Chose:** Preserve refresh token expiry and proactively refresh cloud sessions
- **Reasoning:** Cloud and relayauth return refreshTokenExpiresAt for durable operator sessions; agent-relay must store it and refresh before access or refresh renewal windows so sibling CLIs can consume one canonical session without browser re-login.
