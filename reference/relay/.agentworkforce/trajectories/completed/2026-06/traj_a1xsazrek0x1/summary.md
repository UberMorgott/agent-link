## Summary

Implemented p11 residual node load freshness and SDK RelayNode liveness fields

**Approach:** Standard approach

---

## Key Decisions

### Kept p11 residual scoped to activeAgents/load freshness and SDK node liveness fields

- **Chose:** Kept p11 residual scoped to activeAgents/load freshness and SDK node liveness fields
- **Reasoning:** Lead confirmed heartbeat/reconnect/deregister already shipped; remaining AC1 gap was stale node load after release/exit plus missing live/createdAt fields in RelayNode.
