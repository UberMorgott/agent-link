## Summary

Reviewed PR 1055, removed accidental rust_out artifact, restored emptied trajectory data, and fixed CLI env-var test cleanup. Verified harness-driver typecheck/build and focused broker CLI/auth tests.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Removed accidental binary artifact and restored emptied trajectory

- **Chose:** Removed accidental binary artifact and restored emptied trajectory
- **Reasoning:** PR diff added rust_out and emptied an active tracked trajectory; AGENTS.md requires trajectories to remain tracked, and generated binaries do not belong in the PR.

### Made CLI env-var test guard clear AGENT_RELAY_BROKER_NAME on drop

- **Chose:** Made CLI env-var test guard clear AGENT_RELAY_BROKER_NAME on drop
- **Reasoning:** The new tests cleared the shared env var before each test but leaked it after the final test, which can affect later tests in the same process.
