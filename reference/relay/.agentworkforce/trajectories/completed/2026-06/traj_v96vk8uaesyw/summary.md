## Summary

Addressed PR 1198 feedback by broadening integration auth fallback matching, generalizing retry handling across webhook and subscription commands, and carrying the broker Relaycast base URL through /api/session so local broker retries target the correct backend. Added CLI and broker session tests; focused validation and builds passed.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Generalized integration auth fallback and included broker Relaycast base URL

- **Chose:** Generalized integration auth fallback and included broker Relaycast base URL
- **Reasoning:** PR feedback pointed out brittle auth matching and inbound-only fallback; exposing relay_base_url in /api/session also prevents retrying a broker workspace key against the wrong Relaycast backend.
