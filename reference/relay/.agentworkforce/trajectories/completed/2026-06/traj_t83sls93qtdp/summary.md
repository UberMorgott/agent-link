## Summary

Fixed fleet serve node-definition loading for Bun-compiled CLI by using native import for JavaScript node files, lazy-loading jiti only for TypeScript sources, and validating the fleet marker locally to avoid compiled runtime import failures.

**Approach:** Standard approach

---

## Key Decisions

### Use native dynamic import for JS fleet node definitions

- **Chose:** Use native dynamic import for JS fleet node definitions
- **Reasoning:** The Bun-compiled CLI fails when jiti constructs its transform backend; compiled JS can be loaded by the runtime directly, so jiti should only be loaded for TypeScript-like sources that need transpilation.

### Validate loaded fleet node definitions locally in the CLI

- **Chose:** Validate loaded fleet node definitions locally in the CLI
- **Reasoning:** The Bun-compiled smoke showed the fleet SDK validator import can be undefined in the standalone binary; the public validator only checks the \_\_agentRelayFleetNode marker, so a local marker check avoids another runtime import failure without changing validation behavior.
