## Summary

Investigated local-up runtime config and PTY broker logs. Found local-up bound to workspace 197732795721383936, home cloud/workspace config lacks explicit persisted coverage for that workspace, and parent broker logs show node_token_missing followed by node_not_found binding failures for claude and codex.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Treat parent relay-hyperagent log as authoritative for local-up injection failure

- **Chose:** Treat parent relay-hyperagent log as authoritative for local-up injection failure
- **Reasoning:** Child PTY logs were empty or only had readiness warnings, while the parent broker log records node token mint failure and node binding failures for claude and codex.
