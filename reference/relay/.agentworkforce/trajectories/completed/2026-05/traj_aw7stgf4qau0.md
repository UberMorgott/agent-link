## Summary

Updated publish.yml smoke packaging to pack packages/cloud, locate `agent-relay-cloud-*.tgz`, and include it in the scratch npm install. Verified YAML parses and added a static Node check that the smoke workflow covers all `@agent-relay/*` SDK dependencies.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Added cloud to publish smoke local tarballs

- **Chose:** Added cloud to publish smoke local tarballs
- **Reasoning:** @agent-relay/cloud is an exact-version SDK dependency after release version bump, so the pre-publish scratch install must use the locally packed cloud tarball just like config/github/slack/workflow-types.
