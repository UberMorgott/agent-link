## Summary

Renamed the SDK spawn API from provider terminology to CLI terminology for the major release: AgentRelayClient.spawnProvider -> spawnCli, SpawnProviderInput -> SpawnCliInput, SpawnHeadlessInput.provider -> cli, lifecycle kind provider -> cli/headless, with docs, changelog migration notes, gateway type update, and tests.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Rename SDK provider spawn vocabulary to cli/headless

- **Chose:** Rename SDK provider spawn vocabulary to cli/headless
- **Reasoning:** The broker payload already uses cli, and provider is stale terminology now that harness configs represent the execution harness. Because this is a major release, the SDK can remove the legacy SpawnProviderInput/spawnProvider surface instead of layering aliases.
