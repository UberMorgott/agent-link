## Summary

Moved implementation into worktree codex/repairable-workflow-failures. Added bounded deterministic gate repair in the workflow runner so failed deterministic checks can be fixed by a workflow agent before retrying.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Use a separate git worktree for the workflow repair runtime change

- **Chose:** Use a separate git worktree for the workflow repair runtime change
- **Reasoning:** The user explicitly requested worktree isolation after the branch was created; keeping the dirty base checkout untouched avoids mixing this implementation with existing local edits.
