## Summary

Revised the PR API to avoid exposing provider terminology at the AgentRelay facade: removed public AgentRelay.spawnProvider, changed spawnHeadless to accept cli, routed headless property spawners through the same helper, and updated docs/tests/changelog.

**Approach:** Standard approach

---

## Key Decisions

### Use cli-based AgentRelay.spawnHeadless instead of public spawnProvider

- **Chose:** Use cli-based AgentRelay.spawnHeadless instead of public spawnProvider
- **Reasoning:** The high-level facade should present runtime choice as spawnPty versus spawnHeadless. Provider is a lower-level client implementation detail and reads poorly at the recipe layer where callers already resolve a CLI/harness plan.
