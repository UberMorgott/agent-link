## Summary

Expanded the SDK workflow reliability contract suite from basic deterministic repair coverage to a 10-test matrix covering final hard validation repair, fan-out sibling isolation, repair-agent fallback behavior, invalid repairAgent fallback, and start-from resume context for cached step outputs. Validated with the named Vitest suite and SDK typecheck.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Cover repair fallback, final validation, sibling isolation, and resume reliability

- **Chose:** Cover repair fallback, final validation, sibling isolation, and resume reliability
- **Reasoning:** These are the failure modes that let repairable workflow errors leak into terminal failures: final validation gates, fan-out sibling state, invalid/missing repair agent configuration, and start-from recovery context.
