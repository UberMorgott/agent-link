## Summary

Implemented headless broker reliability fixes: no-dashboard startup now detaches by default with a foreground escape hatch, status supports --wait-for polling, orchestration skills now recommend detached startup/readiness polling, and docs/BROKER_HEADLESS_RELIABILITY.md captures the corrected current-main plan and verification.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Treat docs/BROKER_HEADLESS_RELIABILITY.md as an issue brief and implement the missing reliability fixes

- **Chose:** Treat docs/BROKER_HEADLESS_RELIABILITY.md as an issue brief and implement the missing reliability fixes
- **Reasoning:** The file was untracked in the original checkout and absent from latest main, so I copied its intent into the new worktree, corrected stale file references, and fixed the high-impact no-dashboard/status gaps in current main.
