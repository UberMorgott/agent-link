## Summary

Updated the Ricky generated master workflow and materialized child workflows so workflow agents use Codex CLI identities only; diagnosed the prior failure as Claude lead/repair agents exiting at child lead-plan.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Converted Ricky generated workflow agents to Codex-only

- **Chose:** Converted Ricky generated workflow agents to Codex-only
- **Reasoning:** The failed run spawned lead-claude/validator-claude at child lead-plan and those Claude CLI steps exited 1; replacing top-level and embedded child workflow agent declarations with Codex lets resumed and fresh runs use Codex agents only.
