## Summary

Implemented Phase A slack-primitive package with local Slack Web API runtime, postMessage/createSlackStep workflow integration, channel and mention resolution, unit tests, example workflow, smoke-test docs, and output manifest.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Implement Slack primitive as a local-only package with a thin WebClient adapter

- **Chose:** Implement Slack primitive as a local-only package with a thin WebClient adapter
- **Reasoning:** The Phase A contract excludes alternate runtimes and Nango, so mirroring github-primitive shape should stop at package/API conventions while keeping routing local via SLACK_BOT_TOKEN.
