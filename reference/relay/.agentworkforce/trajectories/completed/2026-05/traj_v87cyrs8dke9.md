## Summary

Refactored runDriveSession (complexity 23 → under 15) by extracting prepareDriveAttachTarget, switchWorkerToManualFlush, captureSnapshotForDrive, syncInitialPtySize, pickInitialTerminalRows, and runDriveSessionLoop. All 387 CLI tests still pass; ESLint warning resolved. Public API surface and exports unchanged so passthrough.ts and tests still work.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Factored broker-connection discovery into src/cli/lib/broker-connection.ts

- **Chose:** Factored broker-connection discovery into src/cli/lib/broker-connection.ts
- **Reasoning:** Drive and view both need the same flag/env/connection.json fallback chain; pulling it out keeps both verbs aligned and unblocks future relay/new/run verbs from sub-PR 4.

### Hand-rolled keybind state machine in drive.ts instead of pulling in readline.emitKeypressEvents

- **Chose:** Hand-rolled keybind state machine in drive.ts instead of pulling in readline.emitKeypressEvents
- **Reasoning:** All bindings are ASCII control chars (Ctrl+G/Ctrl+C/Ctrl+B prefix). Tiny stateful parser handles cross-chunk Ctrl+B prefix cleanly and is trivially testable.

### Overload existing 'run' command rather than registering a second one — Commander only allows one verb per name and there's already a workflow-runner 'run <file>'

- **Chose:** Overload existing 'run' command rather than registering a second one — Commander only allows one verb per name and there's already a workflow-runner 'run <file>'
- **Reasoning:** Adds -n/--mode/--ephemeral flags and dispatches to spawn-and-attach when -n is set, otherwise falls through to the existing workflow runner. Preserves backward compatibility for all existing 'run <file>' invocations.

### relay copies-and-trims drive rather than sharing a base class

- **Chose:** relay copies-and-trims drive rather than sharing a base class
- **Reasoning:** Trimmed surface (no queue UI, no Ctrl+G, no delivery_queued/agent_pending_drained tracking) is small enough that an abstraction layer would cost more clarity than it saves. drive.ts is documented as canonical; relay.ts header comment points there. If a third sibling lands, factor.

### Silent -n alias dispatched via argv pre-parser before commander runs, not via a hidden internal verb

- **Chose:** Silent -n alias dispatched via argv pre-parser before commander runs, not via a hidden internal verb
- **Reasoning:** Pre-parser (parseVerblessAlias) catches the four canonical shapes (-n NAME, --name NAME, -nNAME, --name=NAME), refuses ambiguous (-n NAME <known-verb>) and help/version, then hands off to runSpawnAndAttach with mode='relay' and ephemeral=true. Single code path with run -n NAME CLI guarantees byte-equivalence; bootstrap.test.ts asserts the triplet extraction matches what commander's run -n action sees.

### Drop the 'run' verb, fold spawn-and-attach into 'new --attach'

- **Chose:** Drop the 'run' verb, fold spawn-and-attach into 'new --attach'
- **Reasoning:** Reviewer pushback: the \_actionHandler.apply() hack to overload commander's run was a code smell signaling the verb naming was wrong. Moving the composition to 'new --attach' eliminates the workflow-runner name conflict cleanly, keeps the verb taxonomy simple (new spawns, view/drive/relay sessions), and the alias retargets transparently — both -n alias and new --attach call the same runSpawnAndAttach helper, byte-equivalence preserved.

### Refactor runDriveSession by extracting prep helpers + session loop

- **Chose:** Refactor runDriveSession by extracting prep helpers + session loop
- **Reasoning:** ESLint complexity 23 > 15. Splitting validate target, mode switch, snapshot handling, PTY size sync, and the Promise-based session runner into helpers preserves behavior, reduces parent complexity to under 15, keeps all public exports stable for tests and passthrough.ts
