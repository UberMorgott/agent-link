## Summary

Added high-level AgentRelay.spawnProvider and AgentRelay.spawnHeadless facade methods, widened SpawnHeadlessInput for harness-backed provider metadata, documented the API, updated the changelog, and verified with SDK typecheck, build, formatting, and focused Vitest coverage.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Expose typed AgentRelay spawnProvider and spawnHeadless methods

- **Chose:** Expose typed AgentRelay spawnProvider and spawnHeadless methods
- **Reasoning:** Issue 998 needs provider-backed and headless app-server agents to use the high-level facade lifecycle hooks, result contracts, channel handles, and harness resolution instead of dropping to AgentRelayClient.
