## Summary

Aligned the SDK with the README target by adding AgentRelay facade exports, session/harness contracts, Zod-like action schemas, receiveMessage delivery support, rich message attachment types, docs updates, and focused tests.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Add an additive session module instead of rewriting DeliveryRunner in place

- **Chose:** Add an additive session module instead of rewriting DeliveryRunner in place
- **Reasoning:** The README target distinguishes harness/session contracts from durable inbox delivery. Keeping DeliveryRunner compatible avoids breaking existing SDK behavior while exposing the new create/receive/release contract.
