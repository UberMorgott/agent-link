## Summary

Added workspace-first SDK/MCP/OpenClaw setup with RELAY_WORKSPACE_KEY as the preferred credential name, retained legacy API-key aliases, and validated SDK, CLI, runtime, harnesses, and OpenClaw builds/tests.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Prefer workspace keys over Agent Relay API keys

- **Chose:** Prefer workspace keys over Agent Relay API keys
- **Reasoning:** Workspace creation should be the default onboarding path; RELAY_WORKSPACE_KEY and workspaceKey are now first-class while RELAY_API_KEY/apiKey remain compatibility aliases for existing tools.
