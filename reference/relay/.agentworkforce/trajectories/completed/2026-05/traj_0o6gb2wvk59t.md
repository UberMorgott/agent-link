## Summary

Ran a fresh end-to-end validation pass for headless broker readiness. Fixed the broker integration harness strict typing issue discovered during validation, verified full Vitest/build/direct headless CLI/standalone smoke/package tarball validation, and documented the remaining broad broker integration suite limitations.

**Approach:** Standard approach

---

## Key Decisions

### Validate via four independent surfaces

- **Chose:** Validate via four independent surfaces
- **Reasoning:** For a fresh end-to-end pass, unit tests alone are not enough. Run the full Vitest suite, broker integration tests, direct built-CLI headless lifecycle, and packaged Bun standalone smoke so both Node and compiled binary invocation shapes are exercised.

### Fix broker integration harness strict typing before running E2E

- **Chose:** Fix broker integration harness strict typing before running E2E
- **Reasoning:** Fresh validation uncovered that the broker integration suite could not compile because createWorkspace().apiKey is typed optional. The harness now throws if the workspace response lacks an API key instead of assigning undefined to RELAY_API_KEY.

## Chapters

### 1. Work

_Agent: default_

- Validate via four independent surfaces: Validate via four independent surfaces
- Full Vitest suite passed: 66 files, 849 tests. Continuing into built CLI and broker integration surfaces.
- Fix broker integration harness strict typing before running E2E: Fix broker integration harness strict typing before running E2E
- Fresh E2E pass results: full Vitest, clean build, built CLI headless lifecycle, packaged standalone smoke, and npm tarball validation passed. Broker integration runner now compiles with the harness fix, but the broad live broker suite still has pre-existing runtime failures/skips unrelated to this headless change, including stale PID-file expectations.
