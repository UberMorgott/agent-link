## Summary

Added bounded deterministic gate repair: failed shell or verification gates select a repair agent, pass command/error/output context, run a repair task, and retry the gate. Added config fields, schema/docs, and a workflow-runner regression test.

**Approach:** Standard approach

## Key Decisions

### Repair deterministic gates inside the workflow runner

- **Chose:** Repair deterministic gates inside the workflow runner
- **Reasoning:** Deterministic check failures should be treated as work for an existing workflow agent before becoming terminal workflow failures; this keeps workflows closer to a multi-agent prompt loop.
