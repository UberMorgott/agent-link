/**
 * Durable, project-local journal of external cleanup work that failed or may
 * have been orphaned by a crash. It exists because several ids have no other
 * durable home once their run ends:
 *
 * - a superseded relayfile-cloud webhook subscription id is overwritten in the
 *   binding record the moment the replacement bind() lands;
 * - a rollback after a failed subscribe tears down resources that were never
 *   bound anywhere;
 * - a crash between any remote create and persisting its server-assigned id
 *   leaves a live resource findable only by a deterministic recovery key —
 *   recorded here as a `subscribe-attempt` entry written BEFORE the first
 *   create and upgraded with concrete ids as they are assigned.
 *
 * Entries are retried best-effort on later subscribe/unsubscribe runs and are
 * scoped to the connection identity that created them, so a sweep never
 * deletes resources through the wrong workspace/daemon. An entry carrying an
 * `owner` is the LEASE of a live transaction: other processes must neither
 * sweep it nor clear it unless the owner is provably dead on this host.
 *
 * The journal file lives in the CLI's project data dir (`.agentworkforce/relay/`,
 * excluded from git by @agent-relay/config's ensureGitExclude) and is written
 * 0600 via temp-file write + fsync + atomic rename + parent-directory fsync,
 * so a committed update survives host/power crashes, and every
 * read-modify-write runs under an exclusive lockfile so concurrent CLI
 * processes cannot lose entries. A corrupt or unreadable journal FAILS
 * CLOSED: reads throw, nothing is swept, and callers abort before creating
 * new external resources.
 *
 * Attempt entries carry the inbound-target `url`, which may be capability
 * bearing — callers must never log entry urls or ids (the 0600 file is their
 * only home).

 * ownership provably spans read → mutate → atomic commit. The kernel
 * releases the lock when the helper exits or dies; the helper commits (or,
 * on an empty payload, releases untouched) when our stdin pipe reaches EOF.
 * No native addon is imported anywhere — this works identically under Node
 * and the Bun standalone, which already ships and spawns the broker binary
 * for its core commands.
 *
 * The helper owns the lock-marker rules (fsync'd v2 marker, strict-prefix
 * heal, unrecognized pre-release sentinel fails closed) and the commit
 * (temp + fsync + atomic rename + directory fsync). Exit 4 = a live holder
