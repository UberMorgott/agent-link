/**
 * Shared CLI exit helpers.
 *
 * Why this exists: calling `process.exit(code)` directly from a command action
 * terminates the Node process synchronously — before PostHog's in-memory
 * event buffer can flush over HTTP. That quietly loses any telemetry we
 * emitted during the command (cli_command_complete, workflow_run, etc.).
 *
 * The pattern instead: command actions throw `CliExit(code)` via the DI
 * `exit` function. `runCli()` catches it, emits the final telemetry event
 * with the real exit code, awaits `shutdownTelemetry()`, and only then
 * calls the real `process.exit(code)` — giving the flush a chance to finish.
 *
 * Tests override the DI `exit` with their own mocks (typically throwing an
 * `ExitSignal`), so this default only kicks in at production call sites.
