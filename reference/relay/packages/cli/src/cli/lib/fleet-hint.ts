/**
 * Best-effort workspace registry lookup for improving "no agent named X"
 * error messages across attach-style verbs (view, drive, passthrough).
 *
 * When a local broker returns 404 for an agent name, that agent may still be
 * registered workspace-wide on a different fleet node. This helper probes the
 * workspace registry and returns a human-readable placement description so
 * attach verbs can emit:
 *
 *   Error: agent 'X' is registered on node 'finn-mini'; cross-node attach is
 *   not yet supported — run `agent-relay node agent attach X` on that machine
 *
 * instead of the indistinguishable "no agent named 'X'" a local-only lookup
 * produces.
 *
 * All errors are silently swallowed — the caller always falls back to the
 * original message on any failure (no credentials, network error, etc.).
 *
 * **Workspace-binding caveat:** This helper probes the workspace resolved from
 * ambient environment variables (the same workspace `agent-relay agent list`
 * uses). When attach is directed at a broker in a different workspace (via
 * `--broker-url` / `--api-key`), the workspace this lookup targets may differ
 * from the one the 404 came from. A same-named agent in the ambient workspace
 * can produce a false-positive cross-node hint, or a genuinely remote agent
 * (known only in the target broker's workspace) can be missed. For Phase 1
 * this is acceptable — the hint is informational only and cannot change attach
 * semantics. Phase 2's `--node` flag will make node resolution explicit.
