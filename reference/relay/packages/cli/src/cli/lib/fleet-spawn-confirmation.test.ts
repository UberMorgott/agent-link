/**
 * Gated proof for issue #1430.
 *
 * These arms live here, under `packages/cli`, rather than beside the other
 * placement tests in `packages/sdk/src/messaging/placement.test.mts`, because
 * the root vitest config — the only JS suite CI runs — excludes
 * `packages/sdk/**`. The load-bearing arms have to sit in a suite that actually
 * runs, or a later refactor reverts the fix with CI green, which is the very
 * failure shape this change exists to prevent.
 *
 * Every arm is a deterministic requester-level fixture. None of them touches a
 * real node, and none of them passes merely because a node replied correctly —
 * the point under test is that the REQUESTER distinguishes "the node executed
 * and confirmed" from "the engine accepted the dispatch".
