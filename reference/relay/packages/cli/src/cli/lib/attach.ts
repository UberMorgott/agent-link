 *      every chunk (live pass-through).
 *
 * Correlation rule: the snapshot reflects every byte with offset `<=`
 * `snapshotOffset`. A buffered chunk carries the cumulative byte offset at
 * its *end*; if that end offset is `<=` the snapshot offset the chunk is
 * already on screen and is dropped, otherwise it is applied.
 *
 * The snapshot offset is retained as a post-reconcile *watermark*: once
 * buffering ends, {@link push} keeps suppressing any live frame whose end
 * offset is `<=` the watermark. This closes a broker-side race — the PTY
 * reader advances `consumed_offset` and the grid *before* the decoded chunk
 * reaches the broadcast queue, so a chunk with `offset <= snapshotOffset`
 * can still arrive *after* the client reconciles. Offsets are cumulative and
 * monotonic, so the watermark drops exactly those already-painted stragglers

 * dropped back to their shell with arrows emitting escape codes, mouse clicks
 * spewing coordinates, or a blank alt screen.
 *
 * The sequence is intentionally direction-explicit and idempotent. Ordering is
 * load-bearing (see #1251): a few of these controls move the cursor, and
 * `\x1b[?1049l` (leave alt screen) *restores* the main-buffer cursor that was
 * saved on alt-screen entry. Anything that homes the cursor must therefore run
 * *before* the alt-screen leave, or it clobbers that restored position and the
 * next shell prompt lands at top-left. Two controls home the cursor:
 *
 *  - `\x1b[r` (DECSTBM scroll-region reset) homes the cursor on xterm/DEC-style
 *    terminals. The scroll-region margins are shared terminal state, so
 *    resetting them while still in the alt buffer heals a stale region and the
 *    homing is harmless (the pending `?1049l` restore supersedes it).
 *  - `\x1b[?6l` (DECOM origin-mode reset) also moves the cursor to home per the
 *    DEC spec, so it belongs in the same pre-leave group.
 *
 * Everything after the alt-screen leave is position-independent (mode flags
 * that never move the cursor): show cursor, application cursor keys off,
 * autowrap on, every mouse-reporting mode off, bracketed paste off, numeric
 * keypad, and a final SGR reset. Only written when stdout is a TTY, consistent
 * with how the sessions gate raw-mode restore and the status line.
