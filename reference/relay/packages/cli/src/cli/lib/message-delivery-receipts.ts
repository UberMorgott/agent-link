 *
 * The upstream create-message response carries the body twice — once at `text`
 * and once at the nested `message.text` — and `directMessageReceipt` spreads
 * that response wholesale. On the MCP path that puts two further copies of a DM
 * into the *sender's* own context window, on top of the `tool_use` parameter
 * that already holds it. The sender wrote the text; echoing it back informs no
 * decision, and it is charged against the context budget of exactly the
 * long-lived resident agents that send the most DMs.
 *
 * The projection is an allowlist rather than a denylist on purpose: deleting
 * known body fields would start leaking the body again the first time the
 * upstream response grows another text-bearing field.
 *
 * Everything kept is fixed-size, so the receipt no longer grows with the
 * message. `delivery` is kept whole because it is the part that stops an agent
 * reporting an enqueue as a confirmed delivery; `id` because it is how the
 * caller follows up with `get_message_readers`; and `target` because its
 * presence — versus its absence on an unresolved recipient — is an existing
 * signal that the directory independently confirmed who was addressed.
