# agent-relay

A thin operator console for a local agent workforce: stand up the broker, staff it with off-the-shelf agent CLIs, and watch/steer them from the terminal. Each command is a shallow wrapper over a backing package (`@agent-relay/sdk`, `@agent-relay/harness-driver`, `@agent-relay/cloud`).

## Install

Requires Node.js 22 or newer.

```bash
npm install -g agent-relay
```

## Common commands

```bash
agent-relay status                 # workspace + cloud login + local broker
agent-relay mcp                    # MCP stdio server

agent-relay message post --channel general --text "hello"
agent-relay workspace list
```

## This machine's node

The `node` command group manages the broker on your machine and the agents it runs:

```bash
agent-relay node up                          # serves an auto-discovered agent-relay.{ts,js,…} node file,
                                             # or the implicit local node from teams.json
agent-relay node up --config ./my-node.ts    # serve a specific defineNode(...) file
agent-relay node status
agent-relay node down

agent-relay node workflow run workflows/my-workflow.ts
agent-relay node workflow logs <run-id> --follow
agent-relay node workflow sync <run-id>

agent-relay node agent new claude            # spawn + attach
agent-relay node agent new codex --runtime native
agent-relay node agent spawn opencode --runtime pty
agent-relay node agent list
agent-relay node agent list --status            # + inbound delivery mode and pending-queue contents per agent
agent-relay node agent attach <name> --mode view
agent-relay node agent release <name>
```

`node agent spawn` and `node agent new` accept `--runtime auto|native|pty`. `auto` is the default and keeps experimental dual-runtime adapters on PTY. Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode support explicit native or PTY selection; Pi and Deep Agents are experimental native-only harnesses and require `--runtime native`.

For AI SDK native harnesses, attach renders structured activity, text, tools, approvals, files, usage, and lifecycle events. Add `--json` for NDJSON, `--reasoning` for reasoning events, or `--diagnostics` for sidecar diagnostics. Native harness `drive` is line-oriented and acknowledged; native harness `passthrough` is unsupported because no terminal stream exists. PTY attach behavior is unchanged.

### Local operation during a Relaycast outage

```bash
agent-relay node up --local-only
agent-relay node status
agent-relay node agent spawn claude --runtime pty
agent-relay node agent attach <name> --mode view
```

`--local-only` deliberately starts a **DEGRADED** broker without waiting for
Relaycast. Startup, `/health`, `/api/status`, and `node status` report that mode.
The authenticated `/api/session` exposes `operation_mode: "local_only"` and
`degraded: true`; its existing `mode` still describes persistence.
The standalone broker accepts `init --local-only --persist`; SDK callers can
set `AGENT_RELAY_LOCAL_ONLY=1` and enable persistence. The API must bind to a
loopback IP, and the mode supports a single workspace key.

Local spawn, terminal view/input, and the durable automatic delivery queue
remain available. `POST /api/send` accepts only a worker currently running on
this broker; channel, cross-workspace, and remote destinations are rejected.
It reports `delivery_status: "queued_local"`, `local: true`, and
`relaycast_published: false`. Acceptance means the work was saved, not that an
agent has read it. Pending work survives restart and waits for an absent local
recipient to respawn without exhausting retries. A restarted recipient gets a
fresh transport retry budget. Explicit release and exhausted transport failures
while the recipient is present still use the dead-letter lifecycle. Manual-flush mode is
unavailable and returns `capability_disabled` explicitly.

Fleet routing, worker presence, remote terminal attachment, node capability
providers, and injected Relaycast messaging tools are disabled. Local agents
receive a degraded-mode notice. Their model provider and any tools they
configure themselves still have their own connectivity requirements.

When a workspace key is configured through the normal workspace selection,
the broker retries an independent audit connection in the background. Audit
endpoints require HTTPS, with HTTP allowed only for literal loopback IPs used
in local development. Audit records never follow HTTP redirects. Queued
local delivery records are persisted in `state-<name>.local-outbox.json` beside
broker state, then reconciled as `local.delivery.queued` events under a separate
broker audit identity when Relaycast responds. These events contain the
original delivery/event IDs, sender, recipient, body, and queue timestamp.
They record local acceptance, not model completion. They are **audit replay**,
not re-sent messages: replay must never execute the work twice or address a
local worker name on another machine. Reconciliation is at least once; consumers
can deduplicate by `event_id` after an ambiguous response or crash.

`node status` reports the reconciliation backlog and the last connection
result. Without a workspace key, local work still runs and records remain on
disk with no upload destination; no workspace is created. A nonempty unscoped
backlog cannot acquire a destination on restart. Keep its state directory and
continue without a key, or select a different state directory for new work
with a configured destination. The outbox
is bounded to 10,000 records / 32 MiB and rejects new sends when full. A digest
pins a configured backlog to its original workspace key and Relaycast base URL;
restore that configuration to drain it before rotating keys or changing the
destination. Corrupt outboxes cause an explicit startup failure rather than
being discarded. Preserve the state directory until reconciliation completes.

Recovery never silently enables fleet capabilities. Stop the broker and start
normally (without the flag or environment opt-in) to enable them; a normal
restart drains retained audit backlog only when its configured destination and
digest match; an unscoped backlog remains on disk. Restart local workers as needed
to give them Relaycast messaging tools and registered identities.

### Workspace binding and recovery

`agent-relay up` and `agent-relay node up` resolve the workspace through one
precedence ladder. The first source that resolves wins:

| #   | Source                          | Where it comes from                                                           |
| --- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Command-line flag               | `--workspace-key` / `--wk`                                                    |
| 2   | Environment                     | `RELAY_WORKSPACE_KEY`, then `AGENT_RELAY_WORKSPACE_KEY`, then `RELAY_API_KEY` |
| 3   | Repository pin                  | `<project>/.agentworkforce/relay/workspace-key.json`                          |
| 4   | Machine-global active workspace | the `active` entry in `~/.agentworkforce/relay/workspaces.json`               |
| 5   | Created workspace               | created only when nothing above resolves                                      |

The repository pin always beats the machine-global active workspace, so
`agent-relay workspace switch <name>` never silently re-homes a checkout that
already pinned one. A new workspace is a last resort: a fresh directory joins
the machine-global active workspace when one exists, and startup explicitly
announces creation when none of the first four sources resolves.

Startup and `node status` report the winning source without printing key
material. Status uses the same five labels: command-line flag, environment,
repository pin, machine-global active workspace, or created — but the two
commands print different strings: startup shows the resolved origin
(an absolute path for a repository pin), `node status` shows a fixed,
relative-path label.

Startup output:

```text
Workspace source: repository pin (/repo/.agentworkforce/relay/workspace-key.json)
Workspace: joined rw_7ccfea89
```

`node status` output:

```text
Workspace source: repository pin (.agentworkforce/relay/workspace-key.json)
```

A Cloud enrollment (`RELAY_NODE_TOKEN`, or a record in the Fleet enrollment
store) selects the node's _identity_, not its workspace, so it never appears on
the ladder. If a stored enrollment addresses a different workspace than the
repository pin, `node up` refuses to start and names both source files and
workspace IDs, never their keys.

`workspace create`, `join`, and `switch` select a named workspace globally and
pin it to the current project. A changed selection records the old name, so an
accidental create can be undone:

```bash
agent-relay workspace restore
```

To change only the workspace this project's broker will use on its next start,
without changing the machine-global active workspace, use:

```bash
agent-relay workspace rebind default
agent-relay node down
agent-relay node up
```

`rebind` is also the supported recovery command for the conflict above: it
writes the repository pin (which outranks the machine-global active workspace)
and clears the project's stale enrolled-node association so the next start does
not fight the conflict guard. It does not stop a running broker; restart the
broker when you are ready to apply the new pin.

For detached startup failures, `node up --background` reports the child error
when available and otherwise tells you to retry without `--background`; a child
that already exited is no longer misreported as an unkillable half-started
broker.

## Local and remote fleet agents

The `fleet` command group lists and controls agents across all live nodes in
the active project workspace:

```bash
agent-relay fleet nodes
agent-relay fleet nodes --name sf-mini --capability spawn:codex

# Exact-node placement uses the same agent-scoped Fleet action as the MCP tool.
agent-relay fleet spawn codex \
  --name api-worker \
  --task "Use https://agentrelay.com/skill, ACK over Relay, then wait for details." \
  --cwd /absolute/path/to/checkout \
  --node sf-mini

# Resume a known Claude/Codex CLI session on its origin node.
agent-relay fleet spawn codex \
  --name api-worker \
  --task "Resume over Relay and continue the prior task." \
  --node sf-mini \
  --session-ref <actual-codex-thread-id>

# No placement options: use the local broker and this exact working directory.
agent-relay fleet spawn codex --name api-worker --task "Review the current diff."

# Opt into automatic eligible-node placement.
agent-relay fleet spawn codex --name api-worker --task "Review the current diff." --auto-place

# Provision a fresh E2B node, require the current Relayfile workspace to mount
# at /workspace, wait for readiness, then spawn Codex there.
agent-relay fleet spawn codex \
  --sandbox \
  --sandbox-provider e2b \
  --name e2b-worker \
  --task "Review the current workspace and wait for follow-up."

# A uniquely placed sandbox worker can be attached without node or route flags.
agent-relay node agent attach e2b-worker --mode drive

agent-relay message dm send api-worker "Detailed task instructions"
# wait is the default: it queues for the recipient's next safe idle boundary and
# can remain unread while that recipient is busy. steer requests immediate
# injection and may interrupt active work. A send ID confirms enqueue only;
# use `message inbox get_readers <id>` to confirm that the recipient consumed it.
agent-relay message dm send api-worker "Please check Relay now." --mode steer
agent-relay message inbox check --limit 20
agent-relay fleet release api-worker --reason "Work accepted"
```

Commands use the workspace session pinned to the current project. Exact-node
spawn and messaging operations also need an agent identity: pass `--token` or
set `RELAY_AGENT_TOKEN` to the token returned by
`agent-relay agent register <lead-name>`. `fleet spawn --sandbox` needs a Cloud
login (`agent-relay cloud login`) but does not need an agent token: when one is
absent, it creates and removes a short-lived launcher identity automatically.

Without placement options, `fleet spawn` connects to the local project's broker
and passes the caller's exact directory, including a nested package, to the
worker. Start the local broker with `agent-relay node up` if it is not running;
a local connection failure never falls back to remote placement. `--cwd` selects
a different local directory on this path. Model and channel options stay local.
`--auto-place`, `--node`, and `--sandbox` select remote placement explicitly.
Legacy invocations with an explicit `--workspace-key`/`--wk`, `--token`,
`--base-url`, or `--persona` retain automatic fleet placement when no node or
sandbox is selected. Ambient credentials and persisted Cloud routing do not
change the local default. Workforce reporting metadata requires remote placement.
Automatic placement and release need only the workspace key.

The sandbox path provisions a fresh hosted instance and makes the Relayfile
mount mandatory by default. Inside a GitHub checkout, Relay infers the Git root,
repository identity, exact `HEAD`, and caller-relative directory. Cloud uses the
pinned workspace's connected GitHub credential to seed that revision into
Relayfile, and the worker starts in the decoded source tree under
`/workspace/github/repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents`. The long-running Relayfile
daemon keeps the mounted source tree synchronized with the workspace while
GitHub push events update the workspace's repository source. Use `--checkout`
when a task needs a separate static Git clone; that mode keeps the live
Relayfile mirror available separately. Use `--sandbox-provider daytona` or
`--sandbox-provider e2b` to require an operator-enabled provider; omit the flag
to let Cloud's sandbox router choose. Pass `--no-sandbox-relayfile` only when a
deliberately bare sandbox is desired. If provisioning times out or the spawn
fails, Relay asks Cloud to delete the newly created sandbox. Runs without a
custom name use one `sbx_<UUID>` identity and the matching
`fleet-sandbox-<UUID>` node name. Legacy custom `--sandbox-name` values remain supported when no
`--sandbox-id` is supplied; in that mode Cloud receives no sandbox identity.
When replaying with `--sandbox-id <sbx_UUID>` (lowercase RFC 4122 UUID), pass
its matching deterministic `--sandbox-name` or let Relay derive it. If
provisioning ends with an unknown outcome, rerun the command with the warning's
`--sandbox-id` to replay the same Cloud identity instead of adopting another
fleet node.

The live source profile includes tracked dotfiles, lockfiles, generated and
binary files, large files within Relayfile's import limit, symlinks, and
executable permissions. Relayfile never places `.git` in this tree. If a
repository entry cannot be represented safely, spawn fails with the entry and
corrective action instead of reporting a partial working tree.

Both live and checkout modes require a clean working tree whose exact `HEAD` is
reachable from a configured GitHub remote. This prevents a remote worker from
silently starting at a different revision. Commit and push local work before
retrying when Relay reports dirty files or an unreachable commit.

With `--checkout`, sandbox provisioning also clones the attested `HEAD` under
`/srv/agent-workforce/<repo>`. The checkout must have no tracked changes or
untracked source files, and the exact commit must be reachable from an origin
remote. Relay's generated `.agentworkforce/relay/workspace-key.json`,
`connection.json`, and `runtime.json` metadata are permitted. Dirty checkouts and
commits known to be ahead of their origin upstream fail locally. Detached commits
must appear in an origin remote-tracking branch, and Cloud independently fetches
and verifies the exact SHA before dispatch. An unreachable commit produces a
push-and-retry error. The temporary isolated
Relaycast credential stays in the machine store under
`~/.agentworkforce/relay`; the project file stores only a non-secret reference.

`node agent attach <name>` automatically routes to the unique live fleet node
advertising that worker. If more than one live node advertises the name, the
command refuses to guess; pass `--node <node>` explicitly. Supplying
`--broker-url`, `--api-key`, or `--state-dir`, or setting a nonblank
`RELAY_BROKER_URL` or `RELAY_BROKER_API_KEY`, keeps attach local and bypasses
automatic Fleet routing. `node agent message flush|hold|auto <name>` uses the
same unique-node lookup when no local broker selection is supplied. Fleet list and
release commands reuse the persisted project route; if that remote session is
unavailable, the command reports the routing failure instead of selecting a
same-named local worker.

From a clean repository already pinned to a Relay workspace, the ordinary live
path is:

```bash
agent-relay fleet spawn codex \
  --name cloud-zero-config \
  --task "Inspect this repository and report its current commit" \
  --sandbox
agent-relay node agent attach cloud-zero-config --mode drive
agent-relay fleet agent list
agent-relay fleet release cloud-zero-config
```

Invoking the live command from `packages/web` starts the worker at
`/workspace/github/repos/<owner>/<repo>/contents/packages/web`. The repository
source metadata is available beside `contents` under `.relayfile`, `.skills`
is mounted from the same workspace, and no `.git` directory is written into the
Relayfile mirror.

For a static Git checkout, opt in explicitly:

```bash
agent-relay fleet spawn codex \
  --name cloud-checkout \
  --task "Inspect this repository and report its current commit" \
  --sandbox \
  --checkout
```

In checkout mode, invoking spawn from `packages/web` places the worker in that
same relative directory in the remote clone. In both modes, private repositories
use the pinned workspace's connected GitHub access; a repository-access error
means that connection must be granted access to the repository. No GitHub token
or workspace key needs to be copied into the task, mount, or checkout.

With `--checkout`, the Git checkout and Relayfile mirror are separate trees. In
the ordinary live mode, source files are decoded from Relayfile records without
placing `.git` in the mirror. Workspace `.skills` are exposed through the agent
CLIs' usual skill directories, and the worker's task context identifies the
mirror and exact source revision.

Detaching leaves the worker running. Only one drive session can own a worker
at a time; detach the current driver before driving it in another shell, or
use `--mode view` to observe. Releasing a worker does not delete its sandbox.
To resume its retained sandbox, repeat spawn with the reported
`--sandbox-id <id>`; when using `--checkout`, the retained clone must still have
the same clean HEAD.
A failed resume preserves retained work. For a live Relayfile sandbox, reusing
`--sandbox-id` intentionally re-materializes the exact clean, pushed `HEAD` from
the current checkout before the provider resumes, so a new commit becomes the
source tree for that retained sandbox. With `--checkout`, the retained static
clone remains pinned to its original revision and the current checkout must
still resolve to that same clean, pushed `HEAD`. Delete an unused sandbox in
Cloud Fleet to stop future provider usage; monthly accounting reservations
remain until their normal reset.

If the workspace is not pinned yet, use `agent-relay workspace rebind <name>`
with an existing stored workspace. A missing or mismatched stored route
credential requires rerunning sandbox provisioning for that workspace.
`--base-url`, `--workspace-id`, `--node`, provider selection, and the static
`--checkout` mode remain advanced overrides. For `--cwd`, local repo-relative
paths are accepted to infer the sandbox repository; absolute remote paths are
advanced overrides. Outside Git, plain `--sandbox` preserves the existing
full-workspace Relayfile mount at `/workspace`.

Pins created before workspace IDs were recorded are resolved automatically
through Cloud at spawn time. The key travels in an authenticated POST body,
never a URL. Nested packages share the repository pin; an existing subproject
pin or `AGENT_RELAY_PROJECT` remains an explicit workspace override.

Large workspaces can add only the other live subtrees an agent needs. Pass one
or more explicit directory roots after `--sandbox-relayfile-path`; the inferred
repository, its source metadata, and `.skills` remain mounted automatically.
Cloud validates the `/path/**` form and materializes those roots before the
agent starts:

```bash
agent-relay fleet spawn claude \
  --sandbox \
  --sandbox-relayfile-path '/live-review/run-123/**' \
  --name reviewer \
  --task 'Review the live draft under /workspace/live-review/run-123'
```

`--session-ref` is a real CLI resume, not a logical collaboration label. Pass
the actual Claude session ID or Codex thread ID and target its origin node.
`--cwd` must name an absolute directory that exists on the selected node. The
node rejects the spawn if that directory cannot be resolved; it never falls
back to the node process's own working directory.
Omit it to start a new CLI session. The project’s Agent Relay workspace remains
pinned independently until you explicitly create or select another workspace.

To run as a Cloud-managed node, first redeem a one-time enrollment token, then start the node:

```bash
agent-relay cloud enroll --token ocl_node_enr_...
agent-relay node up
```

With a stored `agent-relay cloud login` you can mint the token yourself instead.
`cloud workspaces` lists the workspaces the login can use, and `--workspace`
takes a name, a Cloud workspace UUID, or a unified `rw_` ID:

```bash
agent-relay cloud workspaces
# 50587328-441d-4acb-b8f3-dbe1b3c5de99  chief  Chief HQ

agent-relay cloud enroll --workspace "Chief HQ"
agent-relay node up
```

`agent-relay cloud whoami` also prints the current organization and workspace IDs.

## Cloud multiplayer rooms

Cloud room membership is scoped to one Relay workspace. Every v1 invite creates
a trusted full room participant: they receive their own revocable Relaycast
human credential and may use all ordinary agent-level collaboration actions.
The workspace key itself is never shared, so owner-key administration and Agent
Relay Cloud organization administration remain owner-only.

```bash
# Owner: invite and manage people in this workspace.
agent-relay cloud room invite \
  --workspace rw_7ccfea89 \
  --email teammate@example.com \
  --token-file ./teammate.room-invite
agent-relay cloud room invites --workspace rw_7ccfea89
agent-relay cloud room members --workspace rw_7ccfea89

# Share the owner-only token file over a secure channel. The invitee keeps the
# token out of shell history and process arguments.
# Tokens use the consumer-neutral relay_room_inv_ prefix followed by exactly
# 43 URL-safe characters.
read -rs ROOM_INVITATION_TOKEN
printf '%s' "$ROOM_INVITATION_TOKEN" |
  agent-relay cloud room accept --token-stdin
unset ROOM_INVITATION_TOKEN

# Trusted clients establish one stable session per device.
# --json intentionally includes the participant credential; capture it in
# memory and do not log or persist it.
agent-relay cloud room session \
  --workspace rw_7ccfea89 \
  --device-id client-macbook \
  --json

# Explicitly ending or replacing the device session revokes the old scoped token.
agent-relay cloud room revoke-session \
  --workspace rw_7ccfea89 \
  --device-id client-macbook

# Participants use their scoped token for agent-level Relaycast operations; an
# ambient owner workspace key is never consulted when --token is present.
agent-relay agent presence \
  --token at_live_... \
  --base-url https://cast.agentrelay.com

# Owner: revoke access and active room sessions.
agent-relay cloud room remove-member <membership-id> --workspace rw_7ccfea89
```

There is no room-specific integration grant or credential service. Connect the
workspace provider through the existing Cloud integration API, then use the
normal Relayfile workflow for setup, mounts, reads, and writebacks:

```bash
# Owner: discover or connect a provider through Cloud.
agent-relay cloud integration catalog
agent-relay cloud integration connect linear --workspace rw_7ccfea89
agent-relay cloud integration connections --workspace rw_7ccfea89

# Member clients use Relayfile directly, including its OAuth/backend selection
# and durable writeback queue.
relayfile integration available
relayfile integration connect linear
RELAYFILE_LOCAL_DIR="$PWD/.integrations" relayfile setup
RELAYFILE_LOCAL_DIR="$PWD/.integrations" relayfile status
RELAYFILE_LOCAL_DIR="$PWD/.integrations" relayfile writeback status
```

`local` remains as a deprecated hidden alias of `node` (it prints a one-time warning).

Node workflow runs use Relayflows for YAML, TypeScript, and Python workflow files.

Hosted equivalents live under `agent-relay cloud …`.
