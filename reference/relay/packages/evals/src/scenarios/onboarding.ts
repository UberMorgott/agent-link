## Managing Worker Agents

### Spawn a relay worker
To delegate work, call:
  mcp__agent-relay__add_agent({ name: "WorkerName", cli: "claude", task: "detailed instructions" })

Required fields: name (unique string), cli ("claude"), task (full instructions for the worker).
The relay worker will DM you "ACK: <understanding>" when it starts and "DONE: <result>" when complete.

**Important**: When your task asks you to "assign to a worker", "delegate to an agent", or "spawn a relay worker",
this means calling mcp__agent-relay__add_agent — never your built-in Task capability.

### Release a relay worker
As soon as a relay worker reports done, call:
  mcp__agent-relay__remove_agent({ name: "WorkerName" })

Always release relay workers when done — unreleased agents waste resources.

### When to spawn vs do the work yourself
If the task explicitly asks you to delegate or assign work to a worker, always spawn — do not do it yourself.
Spawn for anything large, parallel, or that needs specialised focus.
Only handle it yourself when the task is trivial AND you were not asked to delegate.`;
