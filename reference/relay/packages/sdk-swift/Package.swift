import PackageDescription

// The hosted-participant transport (`AgentRelaySDK`) is a thin facade over the
// relaycast Swift engine SDK (product `Relaycast`).
//
// relaycast's Swift SDK lives in a subdirectory of the relaycast monorepo
// (`packages/sdk-swift`), so it cannot be consumed as a plain git-URL SwiftPM
// dependency on its own (git dependencies require `Package.swift` at the
// repository root). A root-level manifest vending the `Relaycast` library was
// added in the relaycast monorepo (AgentWorkforce/relaycast#208) and published
// as v4.2.0; this package depends on it via that repository's git URL.
//
