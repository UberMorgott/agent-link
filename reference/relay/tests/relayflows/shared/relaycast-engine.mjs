/**
 * Bring up a REAL Relaycast engine, not a stand-in.
 *
 * `@relaycast/engine` publishes `dist/bin/serve.js`, which runs standalone
 * against a local sqlite file. That gives cases authentic registration,
 * identity, node-control and delivery semantics — the things an in-case fake
 * would otherwise get to decide for itself.
 *
 * The engine's `better-sqlite3` dependency ships no prebuilt binary in its
 * tarball, so installation may need to fetch one or compile it. That is why
 * `ensureEngine` reports its own failure precisely: an engine that cannot be
 * installed is an infrastructure fault, and a case must say so rather than
 * silently degrade into proving nothing.
 *
 * Shared by every RelayFlow case that needs a real engine. It previously lived
 * as a per-case copy; `ENGINE_VERSION` and the fragile binding-normalisation
 * fallback below are exactly the things that must not silently diverge between
 * cases, so they live here once.
