/**
 * relay#1678 — whether a node-control `deliver` frame reaches the broker is
 * not observable on a running broker.
 *
 * A silent agent has one first question: did the engine's `deliver` frame get
 * here at all? On the base broker nothing can answer it. The delivery book has
 * no introspection, and every step of the inbound path reports itself only
 * through `tracing` — so a broker started without `RUST_LOG` (which is how
 * brokers actually run) emits nothing. The only way to get evidence is to
 * restart the broker with logging on, which discards the in-memory cursors
 * that hold the evidence. That is the gap this case pins.
 *
 * Base: `GET /api/node-delivery` does not exist. Arrival is unobservable.
 * Head: the endpoint reports frame counters, the delivery book's verdict on
 * each frame, and where the frame ended up.
 *
 * The broker here is started with RUST_LOG DELIBERATELY UNSET. An instrument
 * that only works when logging is already on would not have helped, so the
 * case proves the endpoint under the condition it was built for.
 *
 * The head arm is not satisfied by the endpoint merely answering. It takes a
 * control read first — node control connected, the agent registered and idle,
 * no message sent — and requires the deliver count to be zero there and
 * non-zero only after a real DM crosses a real engine. Without that control a
 * counter stuck at 1, or one incremented by registration traffic, would pass.
