/**
 * Scenario S02 — Release a worker agent on completion.
 *
 * A worker is pre-spawned (cat shim) with a known name. It sends "DONE: …" to
 * the lead. The lead must call remove_agent to release the worker.
 *
 * Ground truth: `agent_released` broker event for the pre-seeded worker name.
 *
 * This isolates the release decision from the spawn decision. The lead knows
 * the worker's name from the stimulus message — it just has to call remove_agent.
