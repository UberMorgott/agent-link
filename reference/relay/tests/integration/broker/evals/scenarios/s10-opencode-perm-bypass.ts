/**
 * Scenario S10 — opencode permission-bypass smoke test.
 *
 * Verifies that the broker's injected wildcard permission block in opencode.json
 * prevents interactive approval prompts from blocking a spawned opencode worker.
 *
 * The task mirrors s08-task-exit but prefixes the relay post with a bash command.
 * Without the permission block, opencode would pause on an EXECUTE prompt before
 * the bash call, causing the agent to time out with 0 relay messages sent.
 * With the block, the command runs silently and the agent completes all three steps.
 *
 * Note: the broker's PTY auto-approver (wrap.rs handle_opencode_permission) also
 * catches EXECUTE prompts as a fallback, so both paths currently pass. The
 * opencode.json block is the primary fix — it prevents prompts entirely and does
 * not depend on fragile text-pattern matching.
 *
 * PASS = agent sends relay message AND self-releases via remove_agent.
 * FAIL = timeout with 0 messages (blocked) or no self-release.
 *
 * Only runs for opencode harnesses (harnessFilter).
