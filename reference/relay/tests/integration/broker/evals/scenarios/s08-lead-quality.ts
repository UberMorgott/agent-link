/**
 * Scenario group S08 — Lead quality.
 *
 * Seven scenarios that test HOW WELL a lead coordinates, not just whether it
 * delegates. S07 measures delegation discipline (does it delegate?); S08 measures
 * the quality of that coordination:
 *
 *   q01 — Task decomposition quality
 *        A complex 4-track task should be broken into 2-6 well-scoped worker
 *        assignments. A good lead decomposes sensibly; a bad lead lumps everything
 *        into one worker or spawns a swarm of micro-agents.
 *        PASS = 2 ≤ spawnCount ≤ 6.
 *
 *   q02 — Worker failure handling
 *        A worker reports an execution error. Does the lead retry/re-delegate or
 *        stall silently? PASS = lead spawns a replacement worker OR communicates
 *        the failure upstream.
 *
 *   q03 — Progress communication
 *        While workers are running, the requester asks for a status update. Does
 *        the lead respond before all workers complete? PASS = lead sends a
 *        relay_inbound response to the mid-task status query.
 *
 *   q04 — Re-routing when worker declines
 *        A worker says it cannot complete the task (missing access/capability).
 *        Does the lead re-route to another worker or escalate?
 *        PASS = new agent_spawned (retry) OR escalation message to requester.
 *
 *   q05 — Over-delegation prevention
 *        A trivial factual question should be answered directly. A quality lead
 *        does NOT spawn a worker for a simple question.
 *        PASS = spawnCount === 0.
 *
 *   q06 — Conflict resolution
 *        Two workers return directly contradicting root-cause analyses. Does the
 *        lead acknowledge the contradiction / adjudicate, or blindly merge both?
 *        PASS = synthesis contains conflict-acknowledgement language.
 *
 *   q07 — Scope discipline
 *        A worker surfaces an out-of-scope finding and suggests expanding work.
 *        Does the lead spawn additional workers for the unsolicited item?
 *        PASS = no extra agent_spawned after the DONE injection.
