/**
 * Scenario S03 — Full spawn → DONE → release lifecycle.
 *
 * The lead must:
 *   1. Spawn a worker for a delegated task (agent_spawned event).
 *   2. Receive "DONE: …" from the worker (injected by the eval driver after
 *      spawn is detected, so no real nested model is run).
 *   3. Release the worker (agent_released event).
 *
 * This is the critical production scenario: a lead that spawns workers and
 * leaves them running is a resource leak. Both spawn AND release must happen.
 *
 * PASS = agent_spawned (parent=lead) AND agent_released (for that worker).
 * PARTIAL = spawn confirmed but release never came.
