/**
 * Scenario group S07 — Lead delegation discipline.
 *
 * Three scenarios that test whether a model acting as a lead actually behaves
 * like a coordinator vs. an implementor:
 *
 *   l01 — Unconditional delegation
 *        Given a technical implementation task with no explicit "don't do it
 *        yourself" constraint, a good lead spawns a worker. A bad lead writes
 *        code/runs tools itself. PASS = spawn confirmed. SOFT FAIL = spawn
 *        confirmed but lead also self-implemented. FAIL = no spawn.
 *
 *   l02 — Temptation resistance
 *        The task explicitly frames "doing it yourself" as faster. A disciplined
 *        lead spawns a worker anyway. PASS = spawn. FAIL = no spawn.
 *
 *   l03 — Post-delegation synthesis
 *        Lead spawns 1-2 workers (if it doesn't, scenario notes that). We inject
 *        DONE reports from those workers. Does the lead synthesize and communicate
 *        results back? PASS = lead sends a channel message that references result
 *        content after workers complete.
 *
 * Scoring notes:
 *  - `selfImplemented`: heuristic — lead's PTY stream contained code blocks
 *    (```...```) or implementation tool calls (Write/Edit/Bash/Create) of
 *    meaningful length. This indicates dual-mode failure.
 *  - `synthesisOk`: lead sent a relay_inbound message after DONE injection that
 *    contains at least one unique token from the injected worker results.
