/**
 * Scenario S06 — Auto-routing: Director multi-worker spawn.
 *
 * Tests whether a Director agent spawned with the auto-routing meta-prompt
 * reliably spawns multiple workers via relay tools for a parallelisable task.
 *
 * The Director receives a pre-composed meta-prompt (as built by auto/director-prompt.ts)
 * naming 2 workers it must spawn. PASS requires:
 *   1. At least 2 relay agent_spawned events.
 *   2. No native Task tool usage (sub-agent detection on the stream).
 *
 * This validates the full auto-routing chain: classifier → composer → Director prompt.
 *
 * Note: this scenario is disabled by default (tagged 'realistic' tier but only
 * run via --group=lifecycle) until auto-routing is wired into the CLI spawn path
 * in Phase 4. Enable with --group=lifecycle or --scenario=s06-auto-routing:2workers.

${ORIGINAL_TASK}

## Your team
  1. **Worker-Backend** (sonnet relay worker): backend authentication log analysis
  2. **Worker-Frontend** (haiku relay worker): frontend login component review

## Mandatory Actions — execute all of these in sequence, no exceptions

You must execute ALL of the following actions. Skipping any action is not permitted.

**[ACTION 1 — EXECUTE NOW]** Spawn Worker-Backend:
mcp__agent-relay__add_agent({ name: "Worker-Backend", cli: "claude", task: "You are a specialised backend worker. Your task:\n\n${ORIGINAL_TASK}\n\nFocus exclusively on the backend work. Report DONE when complete with a concise summary." })

**[ACTION 2 — EXECUTE NOW, immediately after ACTION 1]** Spawn Worker-Frontend:
mcp__agent-relay__add_agent({ name: "Worker-Frontend", cli: "claude", task: "You are a specialised frontend worker. Your task:\n\n${ORIGINAL_TASK}\n\nFocus exclusively on the frontend work. Report DONE when complete with a concise summary." })

**[ACTION 3]** Only after BOTH workers are spawned, wait for DONE DMs from Worker-Backend and Worker-Frontend.

**[ACTION 4]** Synthesise their findings.

**[ACTION 5]** Release each worker:
mcp__agent-relay__remove_agent({ name: "Worker-Backend" })
mcp__agent-relay__remove_agent({ name: "Worker-Frontend" })

**[ACTION 6]** Report synthesised result to the channel.

## Your relay worker tools
- Spawn a relay worker: mcp__agent-relay__add_agent({ name, cli: "claude", task })
- Release a relay worker: mcp__agent-relay__remove_agent({ name })

Each relay worker DMs you "ACK: <understanding>" when it starts and "DONE: <result>" when done.
Ignore ACK DMs until all workers are spawned. Release workers as soon as they report DONE.`;
