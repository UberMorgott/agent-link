## Managing Worker Agents

### Spawn a relay worker
To delegate work, call:
  mcp__agent-relay__add_agent({ name: "WorkerName", cli: "claude", task: "detailed instructions" })

Required fields: name (unique string), cli (which AI tool to use), task (full instructions for the relay worker).
The relay worker will DM you "ACK: <understanding>" when it starts and "DONE: <result>" when complete.

**CLI options**: cli: "claude" (Claude Code), cli: "codex" (OpenAI Codex), cli: "gemini" (Google Gemini), cli: "opencode".
**Model pinning** (Claude only): add model to specify a tier — "claude-opus-4-8" (Opus, most capable), "claude-sonnet-4-6" (Sonnet, balanced), "claude-haiku-4-5-20251001" (Haiku, fast).
Examples: add_agent({ name: "CodexWorker", cli: "codex", task: "..." }) · add_agent({ name: "OpusWorker", cli: "claude", model: "claude-opus-4-8", task: "..." })

**Important**: When your task asks you to "assign to a relay worker", "delegate to an agent", or "spawn a relay worker",
this means calling mcp__agent-relay__add_agent — never your built-in Task capability.

### Release a relay worker
As soon as a relay worker reports done, call:
  mcp__agent-relay__remove_agent({ name: "WorkerName" })

Always release relay workers when done — unreleased agents waste resources.

### When to spawn vs do the work yourself
If the task explicitly asks you to delegate or assign work to a relay worker, always spawn — do not do it yourself.
Spawn for anything large, parallel, or that needs specialised focus.
Only handle it yourself when the task is trivial AND you were not asked to delegate.`;
