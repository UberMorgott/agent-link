/**
 * Obligation-lifecycle conformance fixture.
 *
 * The defect: a message can be delivered, injected, READ, and never answered,
 * and nothing in the system can tell that state apart from an answered one.
 * The settled fix: **an obligation is discharged only when the obligating
 * author (or its named discharge delegate) confirms it was answered** — not on
 * read, not on a timer, not on the recipient's belief that it replied.
 *
 * This file does not implement that. It is the test that proves it is missing
 * and that discriminates between an implementation of it and an implementation
 * that merely never discharges anything.
 *
 * ── Why the arms come in a pair ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "Fails before the change" proves novelty, not relevance: every test of a
 * feature that does not exist fails. What discriminates is the pair.
 *
 *   Arm A (must-fire)     delivered + read + a non-answering reply + the
 *                         recipient reacts `done` + reacts `seen`
 *                         -> the obligation MUST still return.
 *                         FAILS on unmodified main.
 *
 *   Arm B (must-not-fire) the AUTHOR reacts `done` naming the recipient
 *                         -> it MUST NOT return.
 *                         PASSES on unmodified main, trivially, because
 *                         nothing ever returns.
 *
 * A alone is satisfied by a host that never discharges anything. B alone is
 * satisfied by today's code doing nothing. Neither is worth anything on its
 * own. A-fails / B-passes is the expected and correct pre-implementation state.
 *
 *   Arm C (pending)       no signals at all -> returns at t, 2t, 3t at EQUAL
 *                         intervals (no backoff), then an escalation observed
 *                         at a DIFFERENT recipient.
 *
 *   Arm D (pending)       arm A run twice, once with read state set and once
 *                         unset -> byte-identical behaviour. This makes
 *                         read-independence observable instead of a promise.
 *
 *   Control               the same suite with the boomerang mechanism disabled
 *                         must turn arms A and C RED. A suite that stays green
 *                         with the feature removed is passing vacuously, which
 *                         is the same failure shape as the bug.
 *
 * ── Running it ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   npx tsc -p tests/integration/broker/tsconfig.json
 *   cd tests/integration/broker
 *
 *   # conformance run (arms A and C are expected RED on main)
 *   RELAY_OBLIGATION_CONFORMANCE=1 \
 *   RELAY_OBLIGATION_PATH=native \
 *   RELAY_OBLIGATION_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini \
 *   node --test dist/obligation-conformance.test.js
 *
 *   # control run (mechanism disabled — arms A and C must be RED)
 *   RELAY_OBLIGATION_CONFORMANCE=1 \
 *   RELAY_OBLIGATION_PATH=native \
 *   RELAY_OBLIGATION_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini \
 *   RELAY_OBLIGATION_BOOMERANG=0 \
 *   node --test dist/obligation-conformance.test.js
 *
 * Without RELAY_OBLIGATION_CONFORMANCE=1 every arm skips, so this never runs in
 * normal CI. It is expected to fail on unmodified main, by design.
 *
 * Requires: the agent-relay-broker binary (AGENT_RELAY_BIN or target/debug),
 * and a Relaycast workspace key (RELAY_API_KEY, or one is minted).
