/**
 * Three-PTY tic-tac-toe E2E.
 *
 * Two independent concerns, split so the cheap one always runs:
 *
 *  1. **Status-line rendering** (no stack, no LLM, no network) — replays the
 *     real `renderStatusLine` output through a headless terminal emulator and
 *     asserts the agent's screen survives. This is the regression guard for
 *     the bug that made a `drive` pane unreadable: a status label wider than
 *     the pane wraps past the bottom row, which scrolls the screen; since the
 *     label is painted ON the bottom row, every repaint scrolls again,
 *     stacking old status lines into the scrollback and eating the agent's
 *     output a row at a time.
 *
 *  2. **The live game** (needs a local relaycast engine, the broker binary,
 *     and a working `claude` CLI) — three PTY agents play a real game of
 *     tic-tac-toe over the relay protocol while a `view` client watches each
 *     one through a real PTY. Skips cleanly when the prerequisites are
 *     missing, exactly like the fleet E2E.
 *
 * See `README.md` in this directory for how to run the live half.
