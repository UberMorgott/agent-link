# GitHub subscription demo validation

This runner uses real GitHub fixtures and observes the receiving harness. It never sends an event nonce to the receiver outside GitHub. A successful HTTP request or a channel message is insufficient: `assert` requires the trusted webhook agent ID, exact authenticated provider semantics, correlated broker `delivery_injected`, and an exact digest response from the pinned actor ID. The observer polls channel history; the receiving agent must not poll. Fresh Claude proof workers are launched with inbox/history/search/resource-read tools disabled through repeatable `--spawn-arg` arguments; capture their tool-call names to verify that no receiver polling occurred. An existing worker must have equivalent verified restrictions before its results qualify.

Use Node 22+, `gh` authenticated for the three demo repositories, a built Relay CLI/harness driver/broker, and the reviewed Relaycast engine deployed in the intended environment. Record observed deployed revisions, not merely source or package versions. Shared Relayfile rollout remains with its incident owner. Product PRs must be approved and released normally.

Copy `config.example.json` outside the repository and choose a unique run ID/output directory. Keep credentials in `RELAY_WORKSPACE_KEY`, never in the config, command line, transcript, or committed files. Pin the real recipient's agent ID and the webhook system agent ID from authenticated roster/history reads. The chief row must reference actual `chief` on its own node; a disposable worker cannot satisfy gate 9.

```sh
node tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/run.mjs receiver-task /absolute/demo-config.json
node tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/run.mjs prepare /absolute/demo-config.json
```

`prepare` creates one clearly labelled PR per repository, each targeting its own disposable base branch. It records every acknowledged mutation immediately in `manifest.json`; it never updates main. If interrupted between a server mutation and the manifest write, reconcile the deterministic branch/PR names before retrying. Never adopt an unrelated existing fixture. Comments and reviews remain on closed disposable PRs as evidence after cleanup.

The runner can provision and update its owned subscriptions using `subscribe`, and retire them using `unsubscribe`. It refuses unowned binding replacements and verifies old resource IDs disappear. Set `brokerProjectRoot`, `receiverCwd`, `receiverCli`, `subscriptionScope` (`issue`, `pr`, or `repo`) and `spawnReceiver` explicitly. For chief, set `spawnReceiver: false`. Start `collect` before `subscribe`; it reloads channel configuration after provisioning.

```sh
node tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/run.mjs subscribe /absolute/demo-config.json
# Repeat to exercise create-first replacement and retirement of prior IDs.
node tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/run.mjs subscribe /absolute/demo-config.json
node tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/run.mjs unsubscribe /absolute/demo-config.json
```

Provision subscriptions with the built CLI from the project attached to the intended broker. Before changing anything, record `RelayfileControlPlaneClient.listBindings()` and `listWebhookSubscriptions(workspace)` and the Relaycast webhook inventory. An inventory timeout is a failed preflight, not permission to overwrite unknown configuration. The current binding key is `(provider, resolved path glob)`: subscribing to the same resource replaces its route. Use fresh fixture scopes and record the previous binding before testing an update.

For explicit context use a canonical VFS glob. `owner/repo` resolves repository scope; provider URLs are not currently accepted by the Relayfile resolver. Examples below are syntax examples; replace `123` with the owned manifest number.

```sh
# A real, confirmed harness is launched before the subscription is created.
agent-relay integration subscribe github \
  --resource '/github/repos/AgentWorkforce/relay/issues/123__example-title/**' \
  --to @ghsub-demo-worker --spawn claude --broker-connection /absolute/node/state/connection.json --cwd /absolute/fixture-workdir \
  --task "$(node /absolute/relay/tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/run.mjs receiver-task /absolute/demo-config.json)"

# PR metadata context and repository context are explicit separate scopes.
agent-relay integration subscribe github \
  --resource '/github/repos/AgentWorkforce/relay/pulls/123__example-title/**' --to @ghsub-demo-worker
```

Issue comments on a PR use GitHub's issue-comment path; do not assume a `/pulls/123__example-title/**` subscription includes `/issues/123/comments/**`. Use the resolved path and authenticated resource reference printed in evidence. For chief's full PR/CI/review matrix, record prior configuration and use the approved repository/event scopes that cover the actual producer's paths. Do not replace chief or manually invite workers to repair failed spawn membership. The owner-authorized subscription endpoint provisions the recipient's identity-bound channel. Normal channel history is not a privacy boundary.

Start the collector before launching the receiver so readiness and the first idle boundary are observed. Configure receiver and negative channels in advance. Use a separate collector on chief's node for its broker delivery evidence; the same run format supports `receiver: "chief"`. Bound each collector to 1,800 seconds, a stimulus response wait to 180 seconds, and negative observation to at least 120 seconds. Keep collectors continuous during each case; a missing interval invalidates a negative assertion.

```sh
node tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/run.mjs collect /absolute/demo-config.json
# In another terminal, after a fresh observed idle boundary:
node tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/run.mjs preflight /absolute/demo-config.json
node tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/run.mjs emit /absolute/demo-config.json relay comment
node tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/run.mjs assert /absolute/demo-config.json
# Wait for a NEW idle boundary, then repeat:
node tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/run.mjs emit /absolute/demo-config.json relay comment
```

Complete this finite acceptance schedule and attach the results to the scoreboard:

`emit` supports `comment`, `review`, `thread`, `ci`, and `merge`. Reviews use COMMENT, including on the operator's own PR; they do not approve code. `thread` creates a root diff comment (GitHub `pull_request_review_comment.created`, no `in_reply_to_id`), which is the semantic creation of a review thread. GitHub's `pull_request_review_thread` webhook reports resolution changes, not creation. `ci` adds a minimal GitHub Actions workflow only to the fixture head, generating a real completed check. It requires workflow write permission and an enabled Actions runner. `merge` verifies both owned fixture refs and merges only into the disposable base; run it last. `--busy` permits a stimulus without a new idle boundary and marks that fact in evidence; it cannot pass an idle case.

Replay/reconnect must use only the disposable receiver. Record its generation and reconnect boundary; repeat a real stimulus after reconnection and require exactly one action for each unique event. Do not touch alpha, beta, gamma, chief's process, or the incident broker. Keep the assignment's concurrent worker limit while reviewing/testing.

```sh
node tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/run.mjs assert /absolute/demo-config.json
node tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/run.mjs cleanup /absolute/demo-config.json
```

Unsubscribe only owned resources, verify their binding/subscription/webhook IDs disappeared, restore recorded prior routes when applicable, then release only the owned receiver generation. Fixture cleanup intentionally does not delete subscriptions by guessed name or delete chief. Preserve evidence before cleanup. The runner's `capturedStimuliPass` is scoped to its captured events and **never sets nine-gate READY**. Final signoff additionally requires complete continuous observation, independent review and all nine target-environment gates.

Run assertion regression tests without credentials or outward mutations:

```sh
node --test tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/proof.test.mjs
```

For an isolated HTTP/WebSocket/broker rehearsal of invalid cwd, early process exit, two-channel membership and generation-safe release, run `local-startup.mjs` with `RELAYCAST_ENGINE_DIR` and `BROKER_BINARY_PATH` pointing to candidate builds. It uses native process fixtures, not an AI harness or real GitHub delivery, and never marks live readiness.

Subscribe-on-spawn requires the selected broker to advertise create-only identity
registration and explicit empty-channel support in `/api/session`. The CLI refuses
an older broker before launching; it also checks the effective channel list in
the spawn response. Existing confirmed local workers are reused without claiming
ownership. For new-worker cleanup, deploy the engine's correlated
`agent.deregister` acknowledgement support before upgrading the broker.

The isolated `local-startup.mjs` rehearsal reads live agent memberships, including an empty channel set, and exercises delayed pre-ready exit, same-name retry, idempotent cleanup, replacement-generation protection, and fleet action failure cleanup. The engine must support `auto_join_general: false` and acknowledged node deregistration. Registration defaults remain compatible for other clients; recovery preserves the current membership set. Cached channel metadata is not accepted as proof of isolation.

The isolated Claude rehearsal used `RELAY_INJECT_RATE_MS=0` on its disposable broker: default paced typing exceeded the initial-task deadline on the test host. Record this setting if used for the intended disposable demo broker; it is not permission to change a shared broker. Two idle responses alone do not validate default pacing.

Run the real Claude rehearsal against local candidate builds with a fresh output directory:

```sh
RELAYCAST_ENGINE_DIR=/absolute/relaycast \
BROKER_BINARY_PATH=/absolute/agent-relay-broker \
LOCAL_AI_INJECT_RATE_MS=0 \
LOCAL_AI_EXPECTED_HEAD=FULL_REVIEWED_COMMIT_SHA \
node tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/local-ai.mjs /absolute/fresh-ai-evidence
```

This starts one actual Claude worker. Keep the assignment's independent reviewer stopped until cleanup completes. It verifies two successive idle actions, a 600-second idle interval, ten distinct burst events, duplicate idempotency, no pre-join replay and an actual node WebSocket reconnect. Its signed producer is synthetic; these results cannot satisfy the real GitHub or actual-chief gates. It retains broker events, source/binary and runner/helper hashes, sanitized logs, channel messages and receiver tool-call names. Missing tool evidence, history/network polling, cleanup failure or missing digest action fails the run. `LOCAL_AI_LONG_IDLE_MS` may shorten a repair rerun, but such a run is not ten-minute idle proof.

Set `LOCAL_AI_CLI=codex` for a separately labelled actual Codex proof using an existing
logged-in Codex installation. `LOCAL_AI_EXECUTABLE=/absolute/path/to/codex` can
pin the executable when multiple versions are installed; the report records its
path and version. This pins the actor to `gpt-6-astra` with high reasoning, restricts the Relay MCP server to `post_message`, and disables web search, apps,
multi-agent tools. The installed Codex code-mode host stays enabled; its tool calls
are parsed as syntax, never evaluated by the auditor, and only a single literal
digest/action call inside `text(await tools.tool(...))` is accepted. The audit requires exactly one newly created Codex
session with the disposable worker's exact cwd, retains its ID/version/transcript
hash and sanitized tool-call metadata, and rejects every tool except the prescribed
digest-only shell command and Relay `post_message`. It does not copy credentials or
change the user's Codex configuration. Unsupported transcript formats fail the audit.
Run only after the independent reviewer exits. Codex results do not establish
Claude-specific behavior; neither provider's synthetic ingress proof establishes
real GitHub delivery or actual-chief acceptance.

The runner also audits standalone PTY control writes after the first idle boundary.
Background Enter recovery invalidates no-poke evidence even if digest responses
succeed. Missing control-write diagnostics fail the proof; initial startup input
before the first idle boundary and the atomic body+submit event write are separate.

Owned cleanup runs independently of the broker API loop. The name and generation remain reserved until confirmed deletion; failed attempts retry up to five times at five-second intervals. A generation-guarded release retries retained cleanup. API failures identify unconfirmed cleanup and its generation; they do not claim resources are gone. Shutdown waits up to one second for pending cleanup and logs any generation still requiring reconciliation.

Claude and Codex use the same delayed-submit and no-background-Enter policy. The
`injection_recovery_disabled` broker diagnostic records that a PTY write was
acknowledged while harness acceptance remains unconfirmed. A body parked in a
composer cannot pass this runner: each stimulus still requires the exact actor's
digest action within its deadline. Startup failures retain sanitized actor logs
in `diagnostics.json` even when the first idle boundary was never reached.

## Real GitHub with locally built services

`selfhost-live.mjs` starts a local SQLite Relaycast engine and broker, creates three
owned fixture PRs/hooks and exact adapter-resolved issue-comment subscriptions,
and forwards genuine signed GitHub hooks through candidate Cloud ingestion into
hosted Relayfile. Nango is bypassed in this candidate rehearsal. The runner verifies
the app-to-runtime workspace binding through the supported Cloud API. It does not
establish a production deployment or actual-chief acceptance. PR metadata events
use a separate signed bulk endpoint; validate that path with Relayfile Cloud's
`local/provider-writes.test.ts` before deploying Relayfile, then Cloud.

Build all three candidate checkouts and commit the reviewed source first. Use a
fresh evidence directory outside the checkouts, Node 22, `gh`, `cloudflared`, Python3,
and a logged-in Codex. Start an owned Relayfile control plane on the specified socket.
The Cloud environment file needs its existing internal Relayfile signing credential;
it is loaded in memory and cleared from the receiver environment. Never copy it into
the fixture config or evidence. Example (paths and workspace IDs must be supplied):

```sh
GHSUB_ENGINE_ROOT=/absolute/relaycast \
GHSUB_CLOUD_ROOT=/absolute/cloud \
GHSUB_CLOUD_ENV_FILE=/absolute/cloud/.env \
GHSUB_APP_WORKSPACE=APPLICATION_UUID \
GHSUB_RELAYFILE_WORKSPACE=rw_RUNTIME_ID \
GHSUB_CONTROL_SOCKET="$HOME/.ghsub-cp.sock" \
GHSUB_EVIDENCE_DIR=/absolute/fresh-evidence \
node --import /absolute/cloud/node_modules/tsx/dist/loader.mjs \
  tests/e2e/github-subscriptions/selfhost-live.mjs
```

The finite schedule is three successive idle actions, a 600-second no-input idle,
ten unique burst events, and a node reconnect with the same actor/PID. It audits
the receiver's tool calls and broker control writes, rejects stale pre-join replay,
and checks a nonmember has zero deliveries. The observer may poll; the receiver
cannot. Allow roughly 20 minutes. Keep the independent reviewer stopped while the
receiver runs. Cleanup deletes only recorded owned hooks, subscriptions and fixture
branches and verifies all original subscriptions remain. After an abrupt process
loss, reconcile the manifest and pending mutation intents before retrying.

The self-hosted live runner records bounded retries when Relayfile rejects a fixture
comment with transient admission backpressure. It requests redelivery of that same
owned event through GitHub (maximum three, at least 30 seconds apart); it never
injects a replacement payload or agent input. `report.githubRedeliveries` distinguishes
such recovery from uninterrupted delivery. Hook delivery status diagnostics are saved
before cleanup. This test-driver retry is separate from production Nango queue behavior.

GitHub delivery IDs can exceed JavaScript's safe integer range. The driver retains
those IDs as exact decimal strings and rejects already-rounded values. Before
starting the AI worker, it requests one genuine redelivery of its owned prejoin
probe and waits for authenticated receipt with the same message identity. This
checks redelivery authorization and ID handling before the ten-minute idle test;
it is recorded separately from failure-recovery attempts.

The redelivery boundary additionally requires Relayfile's explicit HTTP 409
`duplicate_envelope` result for the original envelope ID before worker startup.
A second queue acceptance is insufficient. A transparent observer records only
admission IDs/status/error code; it leaves request bytes and response behavior
unchanged. The stale-prejoin negative is checked again at the end of the full run.

For a quick check of only this fixture/auth/admission boundary, use
`GHSUB_PREFLIGHT_ONLY=1` with the same command and a fresh evidence directory.
This creates no AI worker and still performs owned cleanup. Its report has
`preflightPass: true`, `pass: false`, and an explicit preflight-only scope; it cannot
satisfy idle/burst/reconnect or intended-chief acceptance. Do not run overlapping
fixture runners against the same workspace: each verifies preservation of its
initial subscription inventory.
