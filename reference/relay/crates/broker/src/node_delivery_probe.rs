//! Introspection for the node-control inbound path.
//!
//! The broker's only message-delivery path is the `/v1/node/ws` node-control
//! socket: an engine `deliver` frame arrives there, is deserialized into
//! [`crate::fleet_wire::Deliver`], and is dispatched by
//! `BrokerRuntime::handle_fleet_deliver`. Until this module existed, every
//! failure along that path was observable only through `tracing`, and a broker
//! started without `RUST_LOG` emits none of it. That left the most basic
//! question about a silent agent — *did a `deliver` frame reach this broker at
//! all?* — unanswerable on a running process without restarting it, which
//! destroys the in-memory cursors that hold the evidence.
//!
//! This probe is deliberately **state, not logs**: counters and a small ring
//! buffer updated inline on the delivery path and read back over
//! `GET /api/node-delivery`. It is unaffected by `RUST_LOG`.
//!
//! Two properties are load-bearing:
//!
//! 1. **It counts before deserialization.** `ServerToNode` is
//!    `#[serde(tag = "type")]`, so a `deliver` frame carrying a field the
//!    broker cannot parse — or a `type` this build does not know — fails
//!    `from_str` as a whole and is dropped at a `tracing::warn!`. Counting only
//!    successfully-parsed frames would report "no deliver frames arrived" for a
//!    broker that is in fact receiving them and throwing them away. The parse
//!    failure counter and [`ProbeSnapshot::unparsed_frame_types`] distinguish
//!    those two worlds.
//!
//! 2. **It is read without a runtime round trip.** The counters live behind an
//!    `Arc`, so `GET /api/node-delivery` answers straight from shared state
//!    rather than posting a `ListenApiRequest` to the runtime event loop. A
//!    wedged event loop is itself a plausible cause of a deaf agent, and a
//!    diagnostic that hangs in exactly the case it was built to diagnose is
//!    worthless. When the loop is stuck, the frame counters keep climbing while
//!    `cursors_published_at_ms` goes stale — which is the diagnosis.
//!
//! Nothing here records message bodies. Recent-frame entries carry identifiers,
//! sequence numbers and the payload's `type` discriminator only, so the
//! endpoint stays safe to paste into an issue.
