// `agent-relay-broker` is a binary-with-thin-lib crate: `main.rs` only calls
// `run_cli`, so every code path the binary exercises is reachable through this
// library. The `#[allow(dead_code)]` annotations below mark modules that
// currently carry unused items (constants, helpers, even whole types) — a
// follow-up cleanup will trim them. They are not a side effect of the
// binary/library split; each annotated module has at least one genuinely
// unused public-facing item that the compiler would otherwise warn about.

// The PTY layer — session management, terminal grid snapshots, and CLI
// readiness detection — lives in the `relay-pty` crate, along with the
// runtime-agnostic session primitives the broker parameterizes with its
// own types (priority queue, injection retry loop, restart supervisor,
// crash classification, Codex session pre-creation). That crate is
// harness-agnostic by design: it understands terminals and agent-CLI
// behavior (prompts, readiness, activity), never relay messaging,
// channels, or delivery semantics. The broker layers its delivery and
// injection logic on top of these primitives, addressed as `crate::pty`,
// `crate::queue`, and so on. (`relay_pty::wait` is used internally by
// `readiness` and has no direct broker callers, so it is not re-exported;
// `relay_pty::supervisor` is adapted through `crate::supervisor`, which
// pins its payload type.)
