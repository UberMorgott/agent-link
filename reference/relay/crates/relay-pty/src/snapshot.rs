//! Visible-screen snapshot of a `PtySession`'s alacritty VT grid.
//!
//! Two renderers are exposed:
//!
//! * `to_plain` — one row per line, trailing blanks trimmed. Same shape as
//!   `PtySession::screen_text`, but bundled with cursor + dimensions so the
//!   caller can present it without re-querying the live PTY.
//! * `to_ansi` — bytes that reproduce the visible grid when written to a
//!   fresh terminal. Emits cursor-home + clear, then per-cell SGR + char,
//!   then a cursor-position command for the captured cursor location.
//!
//! Both are consumed by:
//!
//! * `GET /api/spawned/{name}/snapshot` — programmatic callers (dashboard,
//!   integration tests, and the `view` / `drive` attach clients).
//! * `agent-relay-broker dump-pty <name>` — interactive debugging.
//!
//! The snapshot is **self-contained**: `capture` walks the grid once, copies
//! out the cells it needs, then drops the term lock. Renderers run against
//! the captured data, so they neither block the PTY reader thread nor race
//! with subsequent grid mutations.
